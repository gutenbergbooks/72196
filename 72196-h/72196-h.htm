<hr class="r5">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.<br><span class="small">“MR. WYNNE!”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>A few days before their departure for
the sunny south, Miss West, her father,
and several visitors were sitting in the
drawing-room, the tall shaded lamps
were lit, the fragrant five-o’clock cup was
being dispensed by Madeline; who was
not, as Lady Rachel remarked, in her usual
good spirits. Lady Rachel had thrown
off her furs, she had secured a comfortable
seat in a becoming light, and was
flirting audaciously with a congenial
spirit. Mrs. Leach was of course present,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
and an elderly colonel, Mrs. Veryphast
(a smart society matron), her sister, and
a couple of Guardsmen—quite a gathering.
Mrs. Veryphast was laughing uproariously,
Mrs. Leach was solemnly
comparing notes respecting dressmakers
with Mrs. Veryphast’s sister. The
colonel, Mr. West, and Lord Tony,
were discussing the share list. The
Guardsmen were devoting themselves
to the fair tea-maker, when the anteroom
door was flung open with a
flourish, and a footman announced “Mr.
Wynne!”</p>

<p>This name was merely that of an
ordinary visitor—one of the multitude
who flocked to offer incense to his
daughter, a partner and a slave, in fact,
in the ears of every one save two—Lord
Tony’s, and Mrs. Wynne’s. The latter
felt as if she had been turned to stone.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
Had Laurence come to make a scene?
to claim her? She breathed hard, living
a whole year of anxiety in a few seconds
of time. The hand that held the sugar-tongs
actually became rigid through
fear. She glanced at her father. He,
poor innocent individual, was totally
unconscious of the crisis, and little
supposed that the good-looking young
fellow now shaking hands with Madeline
was actually his son-in-law!</p>

<p>“Oh, how do you do?” faltered Miss
West, and raising a swift, appealing, half-terrified
look to the stranger. “Papa,
let me introduce Mr. Wynne.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wynne bowed, uttered a few
commonplaces to the invalid, and stood
talking to him for some time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mr. West noticed with
satisfaction the air of refinement and of
blue blood (which he adored) in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
visitor’s appearance and carriage. Wynne
was a good name.</p>

<p>No one guessed at the situation,
except Lord Tony. His breath was taken
away, he looked, he gaped, he repeated
the same thing four times over to
Mrs. Veryphast—who began to think that
this jovial little nobleman was a fool.
To see Miss West thus calmly (it looked
so at a distance) present her husband
to her father, as he afterwards expressed
it, “completely floored him.”
And the old chap, innocent as an
infant, and Wynne as cool as a cucumber,
as self-possessed as it was possible
to be!</p>

<p>And then suddenly Lady Rachel turned
round and saw him, and called out in her
shrill, clear voice, “Why, Mr. Wynne, is
it possible! who would have thought of
seeing <i>you</i> here? Come over and sit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
beside me,” making room on the Chesterfield
couch, “and amuse me.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I’m not a very amusing
person,” he replied, accepting her beringed
fingers, and standing before her.</p>

<p>“You can be, if you like; but perhaps
you now reserve all your witty sayings for
your stories. Are you writing anything
at present?” (Stereotyped question to
author.)</p>

<p>“No, not at present,” rather stiffly.</p>

<p>“I did not know you knew the Wests.
Maddie, dear,” raising her voice, “you
never told me that you and Mr. Wynne
were acquaintances.”</p>

<p>Madeline affected not to hear, and
stooped to pick up the tea-cosy, and
hide a face which had grown haggard;
whilst Mr. West, who had gathered that
Wynne was a rising man, and that his
books were getting talked about, invited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
him to come and sit near him, and tell
him if there was anything going on—anything
in the evening papers?</p>

<p>“You see, I’m still a bit of an invalid,”
indicating a walking-stick; “shaky on
my pins, and not allowed to go to my
club. I’ve had a very sharp attack, and
I’m only waiting till the weather is a
little milder to start for the south of
France.” He had taken quite a fancy
to this Wynne (and he did not often fall
in love at first sight).</p>

<p>Madeline looked on as she handed her
husband a cup of tea, by her parent’s
orders, and was spellbound with amazement
and trepidation to see Laurence
and her father, seated side by side,
amiably talking politics, both being, as
it providentially happened, of the same
party. This was to her almost as
startling a spectacle as if an actual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
miracle had been performed in the drawing-room
before her eyes.</p>

<p>That her attention strayed in one
particular direction did not escape Mrs.
Leach’s observation. Could this be——But
no, he was far too presentable, he was
evidently one of the Wynnes of Rivals
Wynne; she herself saw the strong family
likeness. He was absolutely at his ease,
he scarcely noticed Miss West, though
she glanced repeatedly at him, was looking
pale and agitated, talked extreme
nonsense, and filled cups at random.</p>

<p>No, no; this man was <i>not</i> the
mysterious friend. No such luck for
Madeline; and, if he had been, he never
could have had the nerve to walk boldly
and alone into the very lion’s den. But he
probably knew the real Simon Pure, and
was a go-between and messenger. Yes,
that was it. Having thus disposed of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
question to her entire satisfaction, and
carefully studied Mr. Wynne, from the
parting of his hair to the buttons of
his boots, she turned and exercised her
fascinations on the colonel, who was one
of her sworn admirers.</p>

<p>Lady Rachel, who had wearied of her
companion, threw him off with an airy
grace—which is one of the finest products
of civilization—and, on pretence of
having a little talk with Mr. West,
cleverly managed to monopolize Mr.
West’s companion, chatting away most
volubly—though now and then Mr.
West, who was well on the road to
recovery, insisted on having <i>his</i> say; and,
as he discoursed, Laurence had leisure to
take in the magnificence of his surroundings.
The lofty rooms, silken hangings,
velvet pile carpets, priceless old china,
and wealth of exotic flowers. Everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
seemed to cry out in chorus, “Money!
money! money! Money everywhere.”
Madeline, in a velvet gown, sitting in
the midst of it, mistress of all she
surveyed, with a young baronet on one
side and a duke’s heir on the other
absolutely hanging on her words. Her
beauty, in its setting of brilliant dress,
soft light, and a thousand feminine
surroundings, failed to impress him. It
was for this—looking about, and taking
in footmen, pictures, gildings, silver tea
equipage, the heavy scented flowers, soft
shaded lamps, the sparkle of diamonds,
the titled, appreciative friends in one
searching glance—that she had deserted—yes,
that was the proper word—deserted
him and Harry. Even as he watched
her, she was nursing a Chinese lap dog
(a hideous beast in his opinion), and
calling the attention of her companions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
to her darling Chow-chow’s charms.
“Look at his lovely curled tail!” he
heard her exclaim, “and his beautiful
little black tongue!” And, meanwhile,
the farmer’s wife was nursing <i>her</i> child,
who did not recognize his mother when
he saw her.</p>

</div>


<p>Mr. West and his new acquaintance had
apparently an inexhaustible capital of
conversation, and still kept up the ball,
as other people departed one after the
other. Madeline knew that Laurence
was resolved to sit them all out, for, as
he laid his cup and saucer beside her, he
said, in a whisper only audible to her,
“I’m going to wait, I must have a word
with you alone.”</p>

<p>After a time, when he was positively
the last visitor, and the clock was pointing
to half past six, he too rose and took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
leave of Mr. West—who expressed a
cordial hope that they would see him
whenever they came back to town—and
of Madeline, who instead of ringing the
bell, crossed the room with the visitor,
airily remarking to her father, “I’m just
going to show Mr. Wynne that last little
picture you bought at Christy’s—he is so
fond of paintings. I’ll be back immediately”—effecting
her escape at the
same moment by opening another door,
through which she waved her husband,
saying hurriedly, “In here, in here, the
picture is there. Come along and stand
before it; and now <i>what</i> is it?”</p>

<p>The room was dimly lit, and there was
not much light upon the painting, but
that was of no consequence to Laurence
Wynne. He, however, took his stand
before it, glanced at it, and then, turning
to his companion, said gravely, “All<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
right. I’ve come to answer your letter
in <i>person</i>.”</p>

<p>“Laurence! I never knew of such
madness! Talk of my going to your
chambers—it was nothing; but for you
to venture here——” and her eyes and
gesture became tragic. “Positively,
when I saw you walk in, I felt on the
point of fainting.”</p>

<p>“I am glad, however, that you did not
get <i>beyond</i> that point. I was surprised
to see your father so well; after your
account of him——”</p>

<p>“Oh, that was written more than a
fortnight ago; he is much better—but
weather bound—on account of the snow
in the south.</p>

<p>“Well, yes; and your letter was overlooked,
and not forwarded. I’ve been
away on circuit.”</p>

<p>“I believe you don’t care whether I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
never write to you or not; nor to hear
what I’m doing?”</p>

<p>“Oh, but, you know, I am always well
posted in the society papers.”</p>

<p>“Society papers!”</p>

<p>“Yes; I see them at my club. Besides,
I can actually rise to a couple of sixpences
a week—and I read how the lovely
Miss West was at a ball, looking very
smart in straw colour; or had been
observed at church parade wearing her
new sables; or shopping in Bond Street,
looking very bright and happy; or—at—the
theatre glorified in diamonds and gold
embroideries. However, I have at last
made your father’s acquaintance; he does
not seem to be such a terrible ogre! You
may have noticed how pleasant he was to
me; we got on like a house on fire. I
do not think that your disclosure will have
the awful consequence you anticipate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
and I am perfectly confident that it will
be attended with no ill effects as regards
his health. I am sure you have taken a
wrong estimate of his character. He
may fly into a passion just at first—I
fancy you may expect <i>that</i>—but he will
calm down, and we shall all be very good
friends; and I am certain he will be
delighted with Harry.”</p>

<p>“I am not at all so sanguine as to
that,” returned his wife dubiously; “and
you have not yet told me, Laurence—and
we have no time to lose—<i>what</i>
has brought you here?”</p>

<p>“I came, as I have said before, to
answer your letter in person. I am glad
I have done so, I have seen things with
my own eyes, and I can realize your
position more clearly than hitherto. I
see you surrounded with luxury. A
duchess could have no more. I see your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
father, by no means the frail invalid that
I was led to expect; I see your friends—your—pausing
expressively—<i>admirers</i>!
I’ve had, in short, a glimpse into your
life, and realized the powerful cords—you
call them claims—that bind you here,
and have drawn you away from me.” He
paused again for a moment, making a
quick gesture with his hand to show that
Madeline must hear him out. “And now
I have come to tell you my last word.
You will—or, if you wish, <i>I</i> will—tell your
father the truth now—within the hour.
It will then depend upon circumstances,
whether you leave England or not. If
your father wishes to have you and Harry
with him, I shall say nothing against it.”</p>

<p>Madeline listened to this long and
authoritative speech with some dismay.
This plan would not suit her at all.
What would all her gay society friends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
say—and most of them were coming to
the Riviera—if, instead of the brilliant
Miss West, they found Mrs. Wynne—a
prodigal daughter who had married without
leave, and who was hampered with a
teething baby? And Laurence was really
becoming quite too overbearing! She
would not give in—if she succumbed <i>now</i>,
it was for always. What a fuss he was
making, simply because she was going
abroad for three months with her father.</p>

<p>“Surely you can wait until we come
back. You see, papa is not in a state
now for any sudden excitement. I will
tell him if you wish in a month, when he
has completely recovered——”</p>

<p>“I will wait no longer,” interrupted
her husband. “I have already waited
on your good pleasure for close upon a
year; put off time after time, with excuse
after excuse, until such a period as you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
could manage to screw your courage to
the sticking-point. I now apprehend
that that period will be of the same epoch
as the Greek Kalends! Frankly, Madeline,
I am not going to stand any more
nonsense. I am your husband; I can
support you—certainly only in a very
modest fashion compared to this,” looking
round. “You will have no carriage, no
maid, no fine clothes—at least not <i>yet</i>,
they may come by-and-by. Your father
is quite fit to travel alone; he ate a remarkably
good tea, and told me that he had
played two games of billiards this afternoon;
were he really feeble, it would be
a different affair. It is shameful—yes,
that is the only word that will fit the
subject—that I should have to remind
you of your child! He should be your
first care. Now, he <i>is</i> delicate, if you like;—he
wants his mother, poor little chap!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
You will stay at home and look after him.
It may not be your pleasure, but it is
unquestionably your duty. You can go
to Mrs. Holt’s and remain there and be
welcome as long as you like. You were
very happy there once, Maddie,” he
added rather wistfully. No answer; she
merely raised her eyes, and surveyed him
fixedly. “I will look about for a small
furnished flat; a little villa at Norwood,
or wherever you like. Lodgings, after
<i>this</i>, would be too terrible a change—I
must admit.”</p>

<p>“So would the villa, or even the
small flat,” she said to herself. In
one glance she beheld her future: two
servants, <i>perhaps</i>; two sitting-rooms,
<i>perhaps</i>; a strip of back garden with
stockings on a line; Laurence absent
from morning till night; nothing to do
all day long, but attend to her frugal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
housekeeping; no smart frocks; no
smart friends; no excitement, amusements,
or society.</p>

<p>She glanced at Laurence. Yes, his
linen was frayed, there was a hole in one
of his gloves, and in her heart there
flared up a passionate hatred of genteel
poverty; it was not life, it was a mere
dragged-out existence, from Sunday to
Sunday—from a sirloin of beef to a fore-quarter
of mutton. Ugh! And, on the
other hand, the trip on the Princesse de
Lynxky’s yacht, the already made up
party for the carnival, the dresses that
she had ordered for both; the costumes
that were to dazzle Nice; the sketch for
her carriage at the battle of flowers. At
last she said—</p>

<p>“The child is perfectly well,
Laurence. I saw him a week ago, and
he was then the picture of health. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
is too young to trouble any one yet,
and Mrs. Holt is an excellent person.
Pray how many children are sent out to
nurse, and their parents never see them
for two or three years? It is always done
in France, where they manage things so
much better than we do. When Harry
is older, it will be quite different; at
present it is all the same to a baby where
he is, as long as he is well cared for.
You have suddenly become most arbitrary
and tyrannical; and as to my leaving you
for a few months, what is it after all?
Look how wives leave their husbands
in India, and come home for years!”
resolved that all the hard hitting should
not be on his side. “You are not like
what you used to be, and you are very
cruel to call my conduct <i>shameful</i>—and
very rude, too. You are not going the
right way to work, if you want to recall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
me home—to your home. I may be led,
but I won’t be driven. I shall take my
own way about papa, and tell him at my
own time; and, what is more, I shall
certainly accompany him to the Riviera,
and when I return I hope,” speaking
breathlessly, and in little short gasps, “I
hope that I shall find you in a more
agreeable frame of mind.”</p>

<p>There was an appreciable pause, and
then he said, in a tone of angry astonishment,
“Are you in earnest, Madeline?”</p>

<p>“In earnest? Of course I am!”</p>

<p>She looked at him; he had grown
visibly paler, and there was a strange
expression in his eyes that she did not
remember to have ever seen before.
Then, speaking in a low repressed voice—</p>

<p>“In that case I must ask you now to
make your choice, once for all, between
your two characters. You must for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
future always be known as Miss West, or
Mrs. Wynne. We will not have this
double-dealing any longer. Now, which
will you be, married or single?” keeping
his eyes steadily fixed on her with a look
of quiet determination. “If you wish,
we can bury the past.”</p>

<p>No reply. Madeline’s mind was a
battle-field of doubt, fear, amazement,
anger, and self-will.</p>

<p>“Speak, Madeline!” he reiterated
impatiently. “Married or single?”</p>

<p>“If it were not for the child,” she
burst out passionately; “if my life is to
be made a burthen to me like <i>this</i>; if you
are always to be reproaching and scolding
me——”</p>

<p>“I see,” he interrupted quickly, “you
would rather be Miss West. The child, I
know, is a flimsy excuse, and of no importance;
but please to give me a direct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
answer. I must have it from your own
lips.”</p>

<p>At this critical juncture the door was
opened, and Mr. West, somewhat irascible
from having been left so long alone (Mrs.
Leach was dressing for dinner) came in,
saying, “Well—well—well—Madeline,
what <i>is</i> the meaning of this? the room
is half in darkness. What the deuce has
kept you—has that fellow——? Oh,
I beg your pardon, Mr. Wynne, I did
not know you were still here. Can’t
have seen much of the pictures, unless
you and Madeline have eyes like cats.”
(No, they had only been fighting like
cats.)</p>

<p>“Answer me, Madeline,” whispered
Laurence in a hurried undertone, holding
her hand like a vice. This action was
not seen by Mr. West, who had his back
to them, and was occupied with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
poker. “Married or single? Now is
the time—I shall tell him.”</p>

<p>“<i>Single!</i>” replied Madeline, hastily
wrenching her hand away, spurred by
immediate fears, and regardless of all but
the present moment.</p>

<p>“So be it,” was the low rejoinder.</p>

<p>And Mr. West, as he vigorously poked
the fire, and furiously pressed the bell,
had no more idea than poker or button
of the important tie that had just been
severed.</p>

<p>Mr. Wynne, looking rather white and
stern, came over, and again took his
leave and, without any farewell to Madeline,
who was still standing in the background
in the dusk, he opened the door
and departed.</p>

<p>“What have you been doing in here
all this time?” asked Mr. West querulously.
“What the deuce have you been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
about? Looked to <i>me</i> as if you and that
fellow had been having a row. Never
saw him before. Nice gentlemanly chap.
None of your ‘Yaw-haw’ sort of people,
with no more brains than a pin, and as
much conceit as a flock of peacocks.
No, this man has sense. I——By the
way, Maddie, you look rather put out,
too, eh? He has not been proposing for
you, has he? Come now, tell your old
daddy,” facetiously. “Make a clean
breast of it.”</p>

<p>“No, papa,” she answered, in a rather
shaky tone, “he has not; that is just
the last thing he would do. You won’t
see him again, that’s one comfort!” she
added, with a final blaze of temper.</p>

<p>“Comfort, comfort? Not a bit of it.
I’d like to see more of him; and when
we come back, remind me to ask him
to dinner—he belongs to the Foolscap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
Club—don’t forget. What’s his name—Wills—Witts?”</p>

<p>“Wynne.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, to be sure! A barrister.
Humph! one of the Wynnes of Rivals
Wynne—good old family. Looks a clever
chap, too. Bound to <i>win</i>, eh? Not bad,
eh?” chuckling. “But what were you
talking about. You’ve not told me <i>that</i>
yet?”</p>

<p>“We were quarrelling, papa, that’s all.
Our first and last quarrel,” attempting to
laugh it off, with a laugh that was almost
hysterical. “There’s the first gong!”</p>

<p>“So it is; and I’m quite peckish.
Look sharp and dress!” setting an example
on the spot by hurrying out of
the room, stick in hand, which stick went
tapping all the way down the corridor,
till the sound was lost in the distance.</p>

<p>Still, Madeline did not stir. She took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
a step and looked at the picture. Strange
omen! It represented a farewell—a man
and a girl. The man was a soldier, one
of Bonaparte’s heroes, and his face was
turned away—the girl was weeping.
Then she walked over to the fire, and
stood looking into it with her hands
tightly clasped, her heart beating rather
quickly—the after-effects of her late exciting
interview. Her mind was tossed
about among conflicting emotions—indignation
with Laurence, relief, regret, all
stirring like a swarm of bees suddenly
disturbed. “What had possessed her to
marry Laurence Wynne?” she asked
herself, now looking back on their marriage
from the lofty eminence of a spoiled,
adulated, and wealthy beauty. A certain
bitter grudge against him and their days
of poverty, and the hateful existence into
which he would drag her back, animated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
her feelings as she stood before the fire
alone.</p>

<p>Such an overbearing, obstinate sort of
partner would never suit her now. He
deserved to be taken at his word—though
of course he never meant it. The idea
of any sane man relinquishing such a
wife never dawned upon her. Yes—her
heart was hot within her—he might go.
As to the child, that was another matter;
<i>he</i> was still, of course, her own pretty
darling.</p>

<p>They had never, she and Laurence,
had a rift upon the tuneful lute; and
now a little plain speaking and a few
angry words had parted them for life, as
he had said. So be it.</p>

<p>“So be it,” she echoed aloud, and
pulling a chain from the inside of her
dress, she unfastened it, slipped off her
wedding ring, and dropped it into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
fire, which her father had poked up to
some purpose—little dreaming for what
an occasion it would serve.</p>

<p>Then Madeline went at last, and
scrambled into her tea-gown with haste,
and was just down, luckily for herself,
in the nick of time.</p>

<p>After dinner, she was quite feverishly
gay. She meant to thoroughly enjoy
herself, without any <i>arrières pensées</i>. Her
sword of Damocles had been removed.
She went to the piano, and sang song
after song with a feeling that she must
do something to keep up her somewhat
limp self-esteem and her rapidly falling
spirits.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.<br><span class="small">A FALSE ALARM.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Mr. West had enjoyed his dinner; his
appetite was excellent—on a par with his
daughter’s spirits. He asked no more
troublesome questions, and departed to
bed at an early hour. Mrs. Leach, too,
had retired (pleading fatigue), to enjoy
a French novel and cocaine, leaving
Madeline to sing and make merry alone!
After a while she went over and sat on
the fender-stool, and had a long conversation
with herself, and tried to persuade
her conscience that she had done
right. She offered it a sop in assuring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
herself that the next morning she would
go down to the Holt farm and see
Harry, and have a comfortable talk with
his nurse. Her father would not be out
of bed till twelve o’clock. Mrs. Leach,
too, rarely appeared before lunch. The
coast would be clear. She carried out
this resolution to the letter, starting
from Waterloo by an early train, arriving
a little after ten at the farm in the
station fly, greatly to Mrs. Holt’s amazement.</p>

<p>She asked many questions, and was
warmly assured that “though little Harry
was not to say a big, strong boy, like
Tom the ploughman’s child, of the same
age, yet that nothing ailed him but his
teeth, and that his eye teeth were
through, and that she (his mother) need
not give herself no uneasiness. Mr.
Wynne was full of fancies. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
down twice last week, and had been
alarming her for nothing.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Wynne—Mr. Wynne,” said Madeline,
becoming agitated and feeling a
certain tightness in her throat; but knowing
that the fact she was about to disclose
must come out sooner or later, and
that the first blow was half the battle;
“Mr. Wynne and I have had a serious
disagreement. We have agreed to differ—and
to part,” looking steadily out of
the window, whilst her face took a
delicate shade of red.</p>

<p>“Laws! gracious mercy!” ejaculated
her listener, nearly dropping Master
Wynne. “You don’t say so! Goodness
gracious! you don’t mean it, ma’am;
you are joking.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed”—very decidedly—“I
am not, Mrs. Holt; and you need not
call me ma’am any more, for though I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
am married, I am going back to be Miss
West—always. Please never call me
Mrs. Wynne again.”</p>

<p>“But you can’t do that,” exclaimed
Mrs. Holt, in a loud tone of expostulation;
“you are married right and tight as
I am, unless,” lowering her voice, “it’s
a <i>divorce</i> you are after getting?”</p>

<p>“Divorce? No. Nothing of the kind;
but Mr. Wynne and I have agreed to
be—be strangers, and to forget that we
have ever been married; and as I am
only known to most people as Miss West,
it will be quite easy.”</p>

<p>“It’s nothing of the sort, ma’am,” cried
the other, energetically, “and you are
mad to think of it. Why, I might just
as well go and call myself Kate Fisher
once more, and give out I was never
wed to Holt! That would be a fine
how-do-you-do! And where there’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
children it’s worse and more wicked, and
more ridiculous to think of still. What’s
to be said and done about this boy?
Who is his mother? You can’t say Miss
West, now can you? Believe me,”
seeing her visitor’s face of crimson astonishment,
“it won’t <i>do</i>. It’s just
one of those common squabbles among
married folks that blow over. Why,
Holt and I has ’ad many a tiff, and we
are none the worse. You and Mr. Wynne
just make it up. You are both young,
and maybe he is determined, and likes to
have his own way, as most men do; but—excuse
me, ma’am, as an humble friend
and a much older woman than yourself,
if I make too bold—you <i>are</i> a bit trying.
You see it’s not usual for a young fellow
to have his wife leave him, and go
galavanting about as a single lady; and
then Mr. Wynne is greatly set upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
the child. A man, of course, expects
that his wife will look after his children
<i>herself</i>. Excuse me again if I make too
free, but I don’t like to see a young girl
going astray, whoever she be, without
just giving her a <i>word</i>,” wiping her face
with a red-spotted handkerchief. (The
family was largely supplied with this
favourite pattern.)</p>

<p>Madeline sat in silence, feeling very
uncomfortable and wretched; but all the
same, obstinately bent on her own way.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Holt, you forget there are two
sides to a question,” she said at last.
“I know you mean very kindly; but I
have to consider my father. He has no
one but me. He is an invalid, and I am
his only child, and must study his wishes.”</p>

<p>“Maybe if he wasn’t so <i>rich</i>, you
wouldn’t think of him so much,” put in
Mrs. Holt, bluntly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I would,” retorted Madeline,
stung by the sneer; “but I see you are
prejudiced, Mrs. Holt. You forget what
the Bible says about honouring your
father and mother.”</p>

<p>“No, no, I don’t; but the Bible says
a deal about husbands and wives too. I
don’t forget <i>that</i>. Stick to your husband;
it’s the law o’ the land and the law o’
the Bible,” said Mrs. Holt in her most
unyielding voice.</p>

<p>She said a great deal more, but she
failed to persuade her visitor or to bend
her pride, and she soon perceived that
it was of no avail. Money and grandeur,
she told herself, had turned her poor
head. Some day she would be sorry for
what she was doing now; and, anyway,
it was an ill and thankless task for a
third person to meddle between a married
couple. She had always known that <i>he</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
was the better of the two; and maybe
Holt would allow she was right <i>now</i>!
Here was a young lady, turning her back
on husband and child, taking her maiden
name again, and going off to foreign
countries. Pretty doings! pretty doings!</p>

<p>At eleven o’clock the fly-man notified
that time was up, and the lady must go
if she wanted to catch her train. She
kissed little Harry over and over again,
and wept one or two tears as she said—</p>

<p>“How I wish I could take him with
me, even if I could smuggle him as my
maid’s little boy!”</p>

<p>“Sakes and stars! Mrs. Wynne,” exclaimed
Mrs. Holt, angrily. “Whatever
are you thinking of? I wish his father
heard you pass him off as a servant’s
child. Well, upon my word! I never——”
At this crisis words ran short and utterance
completely failed her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>“Mind you write to me often, Mrs.
Holt—even one line. I have left you a
packet of addressed and stamped envelopes.
Please write at least once a
week,” and, with a hurried good-bye she
stepped into the fly, pulled down her
veil, and was driven off, leaving Mrs.
Holt and her son upon the steps, the
former exclaiming—</p>

<p>“Well, if she don’t beat all!” whilst
Master Wynne dragged violently at her
apron, and, pointing to the rapidly disappearing
carriage, shouted gleefully—</p>

<p>“Gee-gee! Gee-gee!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“It is all right, my dear,” whispered
Mrs. Leach, receiving her with a significant
nod. “I told your father you
had gone to lunch with the Countess of
Cabinteely, and he was perfectly satisfied.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>In another week Madeline was very
pleasantly settled in a charming villa at
Nice looking out over the blue tideless
sea and the Promenade des Anglais. She
had a landau and pair, a pony carriage,
and an “at home” day, for not a few of
their London acquaintances, early as it
was, had come south.</p>

<p>Her father rapidly regained his usual
health and amiability, and lavished presents
upon her. The horizon before her
was literally and metaphorically bright.
She was surrounded by quite a brilliant
pageantry of flatterers and followers, and
could not help feeling a pardonable pride
in the sensation she created and in her
remarkable social triumphs—in finding
bouquets left daily at her door, in seeing
her name in enthusiastic little paragraphs
in the local papers, in hearing
that the fact of her expected presence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
brought numbers to an assembly or
entertainment in order to see the lovely
Miss West, to know that she had not
an ambition in the world unfulfilled.</p>

<p>Was not this all-sufficient to prove
that her millennium of happiness had
commenced? She was the beauty of
the season, though she was in this particular
the victim of an unsought reputation;
she had never aspired to the
honour, and the character had been
forced upon her. All the same, she did
not dislike the position of social queen;
and as to Mr. West, he gloried in the
fact, and basked in the light of her reflected
splendour. He was even content
to be known as “Miss West’s father.”
As some men pride themselves on their
family, their estates, race-horses, pictures,
collection of old china, or silver,
he prided himself upon his <i>daughter</i>, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
was convinced that he got more enjoyment
out of his hobby than most people. She
was always <i>en evidence</i>, and he could
see the curious, envious, and admiring
eyes, as he drove with her about Nice,
walked with her on the British Quarterdeck
at Monte Carlo, or escorted her to
concerts, receptions, balls, or garden
parties. Foreign dukes and princes were
supremely affable to him—all on account
of the <i>beaux yeux</i> of his charming and
celebrated Madeline.</p>

<p>Worth and Doucet had <i>carte blanche</i>,
for Madeline’s costumes must be worthy
of her, and Madeline was not averse to
the idea. A new hat, which became the
rage, was named after her. Such is
fame! A new yacht had been honoured
by the same distinction. Youth, beauty,
wealth, celebrity—even Fortune seemed
to go out of her way to crowd favours upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
this lucky young lady; but, alas! we all
know that fortune is a fickle jade, who
smiles at one moment, and who scowls
the next. Thus, as a kind of social
divinity in a gay, earthly Paradise, winter
glided on with Madeline. Spring had
appeared with a radiant face and a train
of flowers; the turf under the olives was
covered with anemones, the valleys were
starred with primroses; jonquils, tea-roses,
and narcissus filled the air with
fragrance. Sea and sky reflected one
another—sunbeams glanced from the
waves, the water seemed to laugh, and
the whole face of Nature was one good-natured
smile.</p>

<p>The Riviera was full, the carnival about
to commence. Madeline was in a state
of feverish gaiety and exhilaration. She
could not now exist without excitement;
she must always be doing something or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
going somewhere, and required a rapid
succession of amusements, from a “<i>promenade
aux ânes</i>” up the valleys, to riding
a bicycle; from a tea picnic to playing
<i>trente et quarante</i>. All her regrets, and
all her little twinges of remorse (and she
had experienced some) had succumbed to
the anodyne of a season on the Riviera—and
such a season! But on the very first
day of the carnival her spirits received a
rude shock in the form of an ill-spelt
scrawl from Mrs. Holt, which ran as
follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“<span class="smcap">Honoured Madam</span>,<br>
</p>

<p>“I think it rite to let you
no, as little Harry has been verry poorly
the last two days; in case he is not better
I think you ought to know, and mite
wish to come home. It’s his back teath.
The Docter looked very cerrius last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
evening, and spoke of konvulshions, but
I don’t wish to frighten you.</p>

<p class="right">
“I am your humble servant,<br>
<span style="margin-right: 2.5em;">“<span class="smcap">Kate Holt</span>.”</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p>This was a heavy blow. The rush of
maternal impulse swept everything else
out of her mind. Madeline thrust aside
her diamonds, ball dress, masks, bouquets,
and hurried off on foot to the telegraph
office, and despatched a message—“If
he is not better I start to-night;
reply paid.” And then she returned to
the Villa Coralie, quivering and trembling
with impatience.</p>

<p>In case of the worst, she told Josephine
to pack a few things, as she might be
going to England that night by the
Rapide.</p>

<p>Josephine’s jaw dropped; she was enjoying
herself enormously. One of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
waiters at the Cercle was her cousin.
The carnival was just commencing; this
was terrible—must she he torn away too!
Her face expressed her feelings most
accurately, and her mistress hastened to
reassure her.</p>

<p>“I shall not require you, Josephine;
I only go to see a sick friend. If I hear
no good news, I start this evening; if
the tidings are better, I remain—but I
am almost sure to go.”</p>

<p>“Et monsieur?” elevating hands and
eyebrows.</p>

<p>Yes, how was she to announce her
departure to her father? She made
the plunge at once. Her fears and her
anxieties were not on his account now.
She was desperate, and ready to brave
anything or anybody.</p>

<p>She ran down into his cool sanctum,
with its wide-open windows overlooking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
the bay, its gaudy, striped awnings, and
verandah full of flowers, and finding her
parent smoking a cigarette and absorbed
in the <i>Financial News</i>, began at once.</p>

<p>“Papa, I’ve had bad news from England.
A—one who is very dear to me is
ill, and if I don’t hear better news by
telegram, I wish to start to-night for
London.”</p>

<p>“Madeline!” he cried, laying down
the paper and gazing at her in angry
astonishment. “What are you thinking
about? Your sick friend has her own
relatives; they would never expect <i>you</i>
to go flying to her bedside from the
other end of France. Nonsense, nonsense!”
he concluded imperatively, once
more taking up the news, and arranging
his <i>pince-nez</i> with grave deliberation.</p>

<p>The matter was decided. But Madeline
was resolved to make an equal show<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
of determination, and said, in a stubborn
tone—</p>

<p>“Papa, in this I must have my way.
It is not often I take my own course; I
do everything and go everywhere to
please you. You must allow me to please
myself for once.”</p>

<p>Mr. West pushed back his chair a full
yard, and gazed at his daughter.</p>

<p>“Do not throw any obstacle in my
way, papa, nor seek to know where I am
going.”</p>

<p>“Ah, ah! Not a lover, I hope,
madam?” he gasped. “The curate, the—the
drawing-master?”</p>

<p>“No; let that suffice, and let us
understand one another, once for all. I
have been an obedient daughter to you;
I have made sacrifices that you have
never dreamt of”—(Ah! the poor curate!
thought Mr. West)—“and you must give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
me more liberty. I am of age to go and
come as I please unquestioned. I will
do nothing wrong; you may trust me.
I can take excellent care of myself, and
I <i>must</i> have more freedom.”</p>

<p>“Must, must, must! How many more
‘musts’? Well, at any rate, you are a girl
to be trusted, and there is something in
what you say. I dare say you have sacrificed
some girlish fancy; you have nursed
me; you are a credit to me. Yes, and
you shall come and go as you please, on
the trust-me-all-in-all principle, and the
understanding that you do not compromise
yourself in any way; but you have your
advantages, Madeline—a fine home and
position, and everything money can buy.
Remember, you will miss the best ball
if you start to-night, and the Princess
Raggawuffinsky was to call for you.
Have you thought of <i>that</i>?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>“Oh!” with a frantic wave of her
hand, “what is a <i>ball</i>?”</p>

<p>“Well, well, well! How much cash
do you require, and when will you be
back?”</p>

<p>“I have plenty of money. If all goes
well, I shall be back in a few days—as
soon as possible—for the regatta, perhaps.”</p>

<p>And so, with a few more remarks and
assurances, and expostulations on Mr.
West’s part at her travelling alone, she
pocketed a cheque pressed upon her, and
left the room victorious.</p>

<p>Her father was easier to deal with than
she had anticipated. Laurence was right—for
once!</p>

<p>Then she ran upstairs to her own
sanctum and locked the door, pulled
off her dress, put on her cool dressing-wrapper,
and sat down in a fever of mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
and body to wait for the telegram. She remained
motionless, with her eyes fastened
on the clock, a prey to the wildest fears.
Supposing the child was dead!—she
shuddered involuntarily; if it <i>were</i>, she
would go out of her senses. Her anxiety
increased with every hour. She was in
a frenzy of impatience, now pacing the
room, now sitting, now standing, now
kneeling in prayer.</p>

<p>At last there was a knock at the door—Josephine’s
knock. Josephine’s voice,
“Une dépêche pour vous, mademoiselle.”</p>

<p>Mademoiselle’s hand shook so much
that she could hardly open the door,
hardly tear asunder the envelope, or read
its contents—at a gulp. Josephine had
never seen her mistress in this frenzied,
distraught condition—her colour like
death, her face haggard, her eyes staring,
her hair hanging in loose <i>abandon</i>. What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
did it mean? The telegram brought good
news. It said, “He is much better, and
in no danger. You need not come.”</p>

<p>The sender’s name was not notified.
Whoever it was, it mattered little; the
relief was inexpressible. What a fright
Mrs. Holt had given her, and all for
nothing!</p>

<p>Miss West went to the ball that night,
and danced until the dawn flickered along
the horizon. She was one of the most
brilliant figures at the carnival, and received
marked notice in distinguished
quarters. At the battle of flowers, she and
her equipage were the cynosure of all eyes.
The open victoria was made to counterfeit
a crown, and covered with pink and
white azaleas. Miss West was attired to
correspond. Four beautiful white horses
were harnessed in pink, and ridden by
postilions in pink satin jackets; and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
general effect was such that the committee
promptly awarded the first banner
to “la belle Anglaise,” despite the close
rivalry of a celebrated demi-mondaine,
who furiously flung the second banner
in the faces of the judges, and, with her
yellow flowers and four black ponies, had
whirled off in high dudgeon and a cloud
of dust.</p>

<p>At last this enchanting period was
brought to an end by the Riviera’s own
best patron—the sun. People melted
away as if by magic. Some went on to
the Italian lakes, some to Switzerland,
many to England. Madeline and her
father deferred their return until the end
of May, stopping in Paris en route; and
when they reached home the season was
at its height, and the hall and library
tables were white from a heavy fall of
visiting-cards and notes of invitation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>Lady Rachel and Lord Tony came in
on the evening of their arrival to pay a
little neighbourly call, and to tell them
that they must on no account miss a
great match—the final in a polo tournament
at Hurlingham—the next afternoon.
Every one would be there.</p>

<p>This speech acted as a trumpet-call to
Mr. West.</p>

<p>“Every one will see that we have
returned,” he said to himself, and it will
save a lot of trouble. Then, aloud, “All
right, then, Lady Rachel, we shall certainly
go. Madeline must trot out some
one of her smart Paris frocks. And,
Madeline, you might send a wire over to
Mrs. Leach, and offer her a seat down.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII.<br><span class="small">MR. JESSOP’S SUGGESTION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Laurence Wynne had taken but one
person into his confidence, and that was
Mr. Jessop. As he sat smoking a post-midnight
cigar over the fire in his friend’s
chambers, he told him that Mrs. Wynne
no longer existed. She preferred to stick
to her name of West, and wished to keep
her marriage a secret always from—not
alone her father, but the whole world.</p>

<p>This much he had divulged. He felt
that he must speak to some one. His
heart was so sore that he could not maintain
total silence, and who so fitting a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
confidant as his old friend Dick Jessop?
He was chivalrous to Madeline in spite
of all that had come and gone, and veiled
her defects as skilfully as he could, not
speaking out of the full bitterness of his
soul. But Mr. Jessop’s active imagination
filled in all the delicately traced
outline—perhaps in rather too black a
shading, if the truth were known!</p>

<p>However, he kept his surmises discreetly
to himself, and puffed and pondered
for a long time in silence. At
last he spoke.</p>

<p>“I would let her alone, and not bother
my head about her, Laurence! She is
bound to come back.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” responded the
other, curtly.</p>

<p>“Yes; she will return on account of
the child.”</p>

<p>“And what would such a coming-back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
be worth to <i>me</i>? It will not be
for my sake,” said Wynne, holding his
feelings under strong restraint.</p>

<p>“I know of something that would
bring her, like a shot out of a seventy-four
pounder,” observed Mr. Jessop after
another pause, surveying the coals meditatively
as he spoke.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Your paying attention to another
woman. Get up a strong and <i>remarkable</i>
flirtation with some pretty, smart society
matron. Lots of them love your stories.
Love me, love my stories. Love my
stories, love me, eh? Show yourself in
the park, at theatres—better still, a little
dinner at the Savoy—and Mrs. Wynne
will be on in the scene before you can
say Jack Robinson! Jealousy will fetch
her!”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t give a straw for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
affection of a woman who was influenced
solely by what you have suggested. No,
no; I married her before she knew her own
mind—before she had a chance of seeing
other people, and the world. Now she
has seen other people, and become
acquainted with the world, she prefers
both to <i>me</i>. On five or six hundred a
year, with no rich relations, Madeline
and I would have been happy enough.
As it is, she is happy enough. I must
get on alone as well as I can. I made
a mistake. I was too hasty.”</p>

<p>“Yes, marry in haste, and repent at
leisure!” said Mr. Jessop, grimly.</p>

<p>“I don’t mean that; I mean that I
mulled that business at Mrs. Harper’s.
I should have wired to Mrs. Wolferton,
or insisted on Mrs. Harper taking Madeline
back, and given her time to turn
round and to reflect; but I rushed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
whole thing. However, I must now
abide by the position I am placed in with
what fortitude I can.”</p>

<p>“You married her, and gave her a
home, when she had no friend,” put in
Mr. Jessop, sharply. Mr. Jessop was
devoted to Laurence, and excessively
angry with Laurence’s wife.</p>

<p>“It is not every one I would confide
in, Dick,” said his companion; “but you
are my oldest chum. You are welcome
to be introduced to the skeleton in my
cupboard—an old friend’s privilege. We
need never talk of this again. I suppose
people get over these things in time!
There is nothing for it but work—plenty
of work.”</p>

<p>Although he discoursed in this cool,
self-restrained manner, Mr. Jessop knew,
by years of experience, that his friend—who
never made much, or, indeed, any,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
fuss about his feelings—had felt the blow
in every nerve of his body.</p>

<p>“Do not think too hardly of her,
Dicky,” he exclaimed, promptly reading
the other’s thoughts. “She is very
young, and very pretty. I’m only a poor,
hard-working barrister; and she had an
awful time once—you know when!
We must never forget how she came
through that ordeal. And, after all, I
have no human rival. If she does not
care for me, she cares for no other man.
She is blessed with a particularly cool,
unsusceptible temperament. My only
rival is riches. It is the money that has
ousted me. The enormous strength of
wealth has pushed me out of her heart,
and barred the door. Time, another
powerful engine, may thrust her out of
mine!”</p>

<p>“Time! Bosh. Time will never thrust<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
away the fact that she is the mother of
your child. He is a tie between you that
neither time, riches, nor any amount
of balderdash you may talk—nor any
number of matrimonial squabbles—can
ever break.”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken in your idea of the
whole case, Jessop, and under a totally
wrong impression. Nothing can bridge
the gulf between Madeline and me, unless
she chooses to come back of her own
accord, and unsay a good deal that she
has said; and this she will never do—never.
She does not care a straw for me.
I merely remind her of days of squallor,
sickness, and hideous poverty. She was
delighted to accept the freedom which I
offered her——”</p>

<p>“And what a fool you were to do it!”
exclaimed his listener, contemptuously.</p>

<p>“Not at all; but I should be a fool<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
were I to try to keep a wife, who is not
even one in name, and never casts a
thought to me from month’s end to
month’s end. I shall be—nay, I am—free
too.”</p>

<p>“But not in a legal sense, my dear
boy; you cannot marry again.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” emphatically
knocking the ashes off his cigar with
great deliberation as he spoke. “The
burnt child dreads the fire. I made a
bad start this time, and even if I had
the chance—which, please God, I never
shall have—I would not tempt Fate
again, no matter what the provocation.
Women are a great mystery: their chief
faults and virtues are so unexpected.
Look at Madeline: when we were paupers
she was a ministering angel. Now that
she is rich, she is merely, a smart society
girl, and——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>“And milliners, jewellers, flatterers
minister to <i>her</i>,” broke in Jessop.</p>

<p>“I intend to make my profession my
mistress, and to devote myself to her
heart and soul. The law is a steady old
lady.”</p>

<p>“And a very cantankerous, hard, flinty-faced,
capricious old hag you’ll find the
goddess of Justice, my dear fellow. I am
going to give up paying my addresses
to her! My uncle has left me a tidy
legacy. I intend to settle down in
comfort in his old manor-house—shoot,
fish, hunt, burn my wig, gown, and law
books, and turn my back for ever on
the Inns of Court.”</p>

<p>“Jessop, you are not in earnest.”</p>

<p>“I am,” impressively; “and what’s one
man’s loss is another man’s gain. It will
be all the better for you, Laurence, since
you are so bent upon the woolsack. I’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
give you a heave-up with pleasure. You
will now get all Bagge and Keepe’s
business, for one thing—and, let me tell
you, that that is no trifle.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.<br><span class="small">“ONE OF YOUR GREATEST ADMIRERS.”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was a perfect afternoon, and Hurlingham
was crowded. Every seat bordering
the polo ground was occupied, and the
brilliant hues of hats, gowns, and
parasols made a sort of ribbon border
to the brilliant green turf. Mr. West—a
fussy or punctual man, according to
people’s point of view—had arrived early
with his party, and, so to speak, planted
his fair charges under one of the umbrella
awnings, and in a most central and
commanding situation, where Madeline,
in a white costume, which set off her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
vivid dark beauty, was seen and greeted
by many acquaintances. Lord Montycute,
Captain Vansittart, and a smart
lady friend (Mrs. Veryphast) shared the
shade of the canvas umbrella, and spasmodically
proffered morsels of the latest
and choicest news, for the polo was
absorbing, the match very fast and closely
contested, the excitement intense. During
an interval Lady Rachel drifted near—clad
in a rainbow costume, and talking
volubly and emphatically to a man. Her
quick, roving eye caught sight of Madeline’s
comfortable little party, and she
swept down upon her at once.</p>

<p>“Oh, Maddie, my dear girl, how nice
and cool you look, and I’m half dead,
standing baking in the sun, and not a
chair to be had for love or money! Ah,
you have two to spare, I see! Here—here
is actually one for <i>you</i>.” She called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
to her escort, who had stopped to speak
to a passing friend. “Madeline,” she
continued, “I think you know Mr.
Wynne, who writes. Mr. Wynne, Miss
West is one of your greatest admirers!
She knows all your stories by heart.”</p>

<p>This was a fiction, invented on the
spur of the moment. Her ladyship coined
many a little lie.</p>

<p>Madeline looked up bewildered. The
gentleman who was taking off his hat
to her was—Laurence!—and yet not
Laurence. What had he done to himself?
He had discarded his beard, and
was fashionably clean-shaven; moreover
he was fashionably dressed in the orthodox
long frock-coat, and wore a flower in his
buttonhole, and the most absolutely
correct gloves and tie.</p>

<p>So much depends upon the style, shape,
and colour of a man’s tie—and the very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
maker’s name! A rashly selected tie
may stamp a man’s taste quite as fatally
as the wrong number and pattern of
buttons proclaim the date of his coat!</p>

<p>The removal of his beard had entirely
changed Laurence Wynne’s appearance.
He looked much younger: he had a very
square chin, his mouth was expressive—more
sarcastic than smiling—with thin,
firmly closed, but well-cut lips. Had
she known of that mouth and chin,
had she guessed at them—well, she
would have thought twice before she
married their proprietor. As she looked
up she coloured to her hair when she
met his steady, cool glance. This meeting
was no surprise to him, for he had noted
the <i>entrée</i> of the beauty, her marvellous
costume, and her train of admirers. He
had not, however, intended to come to
such close quarters. He was taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
unawares when he found himself in her
neighbourhood, and he was determined
to escape immediately, in spite of Lady
Rachel. The silence that followed Lady
Rachel’s loud prattle was becoming
noticeable, and curious eyes were turned
upon him when he said very distinctly—</p>

<p>“I don’t know if I am so fortunate
as to be remembered by—Miss West?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” she answered, rather
obviously avoiding looking at him, with
a bright patch of colour on either cheek.</p>

<p>“Miss West has such an enormous
acquaintance of young men that she
must get a little confused sometimes—a
little mixed, don’t you, Maddie? Now,
Mr. Wynne, I see what you are up to,”
said Lady Rachel; “but no, you shall
not run away. Here, sit upon this chair.
I had great difficulty in capturing you,
you are so run-after and spoilt, and now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
I am not going to let you desert. You
ought to be thankful for a seat in the
shade, and amongst such pleasant company!”
As he reluctantly seated himself
at the very outskirts of the group, she
continued—“Now, you must not sit there
looking like a snared animal, watching
for some chance of escape. Do tell me
all about the heroine of your last story.
How is it that you are so familiar with
all our little ways, and weaknesses? You
know too much. One would almost
suppose that you were a married man!”</p>

<p>“I think it must be time to go to tea,”
said Madeline, glancing appealingly at
her father, who had just joined them.</p>

<p>“Tea! Don’t you wish you may get it!
There is not a single vacant table on the
lawn. I’ve just been to look. Hullo!
Ah—er—Wynne, how do you do?”</p>

<p>Mr. Wynne had been pointed out to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
him as a rising junior at the bar—a
coming man in literature, who wielded
an able pen, and was quite one of the
season’s minor celebrities. His sketches
were a feature of the day—a short one,
naturally. Every one was talking of him.</p>

<p>Mr. West loved a celebrity—if he was
gentlemanly and in good society, <i>bien
entendu</i>—nearly as much as he loved a
lord, but not quite; and he added—</p>

<p>“I remember you were at our house
last winter, and you are interested in
paintings and art. You must look us
up, eh?—and come and dine.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. You are very kind.”</p>

<p>“We’ve just come back from the
Riviera. Delightful place! Were you
ever there?”</p>

<p>“No, I’ve never been nearer to it
than Lyons.”</p>

<p>“But I’ve been there,” broke in Lady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
Rachel; “and I shall never go again,
on account of the earthquakes, although
it was capital fun at the time.”</p>

<p>“Fun!” repeated Mr. West, with a
look of amazement.</p>

<p>“Yes, half the refugees were running
about in blankets fastened with hairpins,
afraid to return for their clothes. Oh,
they were too absurd! A whole train
full went to Paris in their dressing-gowns—some
in bare feet. Every one
was different—‘out of themselves,’ as
they say in France. One old lady, in
her mad excitement in speeding some
relations, actually tore off her wig and
waved it after them.”</p>

<p>“Poor old dear! <i>How</i> she must have
regretted it subsequently!” said Lord
Montycute. “My sister was there at
the same time, and paid twenty pounds
a night for the luxury of sleeping in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
hotel omnibus. Nothing would induce
her to go to bed indoors. The hotel was
cracked from top to bottom!”</p>

<p>“I don’t care for the Riviera,” remarked
Lady Rachel. “It’s too hot,
and the scenery is ridiculously gaudy.
It always reminded me of a drop-scene.
I declare to you, sitting on a promenade,
facing the blue sea and blue sky, and
pale, buff promontories and palms, with
a band playing in the neighbourhood,
I have felt as if I was in the stalls
of a theatre.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shame!” cried Mrs. Leach.
“You have no feeling for the beauties
of Nature.”</p>

<p>“I thought Monte Carlo lovely—the
garden too exquisite for words.”</p>

<p>“And the tables?” inquired Mr.
West significantly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I had my own <i>pet</i> table; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
at first I was successful. I always went
on the ‘doz-ens,’ or ‘passe.’ One day
I made ninety pounds in an hour; but,
alas! I lost it all in about ten minutes.”</p>

<p>“The tables always <i>do</i> win in the long
run,” said Mr. West, sententiously.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Lord Montycute, “they
have no feeling, no emotions. When
they gain they are not excited; when
they lose they are not depressed; and
this is their advantage.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but they cannot leave off if they
<i>are</i> losing,” cried Lady Rachel. “We
score there.”</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> did not score, at any rate,”
remarked Mrs. Leach, with a smile.</p>

<p>“No; I wish I <i>had</i> left off. There
is Mrs. Raymond Tufto. Did you see
her at Nice, Madeline?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes; she went everywhere.”</p>

<p>“She is wearing that same flower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
toque. I <i>am</i> so sick of it,” cried Mrs.
Veryphast, impatiently.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless she is one of the
prettiest women in London,” observed
Captain Vansittart. “She has such a
saintly expression, and she looks so <i>good</i>.”</p>

<p>“She is a horribly heartless wretch.
She goes off for months on the Continent,
and leaves her children to nurses at
home,” said Lady Rachel, viciously.
“She has one dear little tot of two, that
actually does not know her by sight.”</p>

<p>“It is quite the French fashion to board
out babies,” remarked Mrs. Leach, who
was invariably in opposition to Lady
Rachel.</p>

<p>“Turn them out to walk like young
hounds,” drawled Captain Vansittart.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Tufto, bad as she may be, is
nothing to Lady Blazer,” continued
Mrs. Leach, impressively. “She has a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
nursery full of girls, and yet, what <i>do</i> you
think? When she was asked the other
day to subscribe to the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals, she said,
‘Delighted! There is only one species
of animal I loathe, and that’s a <i>child</i>.’”</p>

<p>“Oh, I say—come! I don’t believe
that,” cried Mr. West, “of any woman—or
even a man. I’m rather partial to
<i>nice</i> small children myself.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Wynne,” said Lady Rachel,
turning on him suddenly, “why are
you so silent? You know it is your
<i>métier</i> to talk.”</p>

<p>“Then why do you grudge me a well-earned
holiday?” he asked imperturbably.</p>

<p>“I believe you are studying us for
your next sketch; taking us in your
literary kodak.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed! I am not a reporter
for a society paper.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mean about our dresses
and hats, or that; I mean character
sketches.”</p>

<p>“How I should like to sit to you for
<i>mine</i>!” said Mrs. Veryphast, vivaciously,
moving her chair an inch or two nearer
to his. “I <i>do</i> wish you would make a
study of me, and put me in one of your
charming stories or dialogues.”</p>

<p>“It would have a fabulous circulation
if <i>you</i> were the heroine,” said Lord
Montycute, with a bow.</p>

<p>Mrs. Veryphast smiled, well pleased.
She was not always able to distinguish
between impertinence and flattery. Mrs.
Veryphast was evidently anxious to
annex another ladies’ friend, who had
edged himself so far away that he was
quite an outsider. But he would not be
appropriated, neither could he effect his
escape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>“Mr. Wynne,” said Lady Rachel,
briskly, “you are up in all the principal
subjects of the day. Do tell us what
you think of the new woman.”</p>

<p>“That she will be an old woman in
a few years.”</p>

<p>“So shall I. You are meanly evading
the question.”</p>

<p>“I think——Let me think again.”</p>

<p>“You mean, let me <i>dream</i> again. You
seem to be half asleep this afternoon.
Well?”</p>

<p>“On reflection, I consider that she
is a devastating social influence.”</p>

<p>“That can be read in two ways, you
wary fox. What is your opinion of the
emancipation of women—wives especially?”</p>

<p>“Upon my word! Lady Rachel, I must
protest!” he answered, with a somewhat
fixed smile. “You are endeavouring to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
obtain my opinion gratis. I cannot afford
it. How am I to live?”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Madeline, looking rather
pale, listened furtively to this passage
of arms.</p>

<p>“I think you are <i>too</i> horrid. At any-rate,
it cannot hurt your pocket to tell
me if you approve of the higher education
of my sex.”</p>

<p>“No; I prefer the ancient Greek
mode—complete isolation, wool-spinning,
and no books.”</p>

<p>“Gracious! I shall pity your <i>wife</i>.”</p>

<p>His eyes and Madeline’s met for one
half-second all the way across Lady
Rachel’s bonnet and Captain Vansittart’s
broad shoulders. Then he stood up.</p>

<p>“What—going? Oh, Mr. Wynne!”
protested his captor, with a little scream.</p>

<p>“I am extremely sorry; but I really
<i>must</i>. I see a man over there that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
want to speak to particularly; and I shall
lose sight of him if I don’t look sharp.”
And taking off his hat with a comprehensive
smile, he was gone.</p>

<p>Yes, Madeline watched him under her
parasol. He looked as well as any one—in
fact, quite distinguished. She wondered
vaguely who was his tailor.</p>

<p>Then people began to discuss him, and
she gathered by a word from Mrs. Veryphast,
and another from Captain Vansittart,
that the general opinion of
Laurence Wynne was highly favourable.</p>

<p>“Of fine old stock, but poor; but
brains, and good race, ought to bring
him something,” said Mrs. Leach.</p>

<p>“An heiress!” suggested Mrs. Veryphast,
with a giggle. “And now I propose
that we do adjourn, and go to tea.”</p>

<p>From a distance Laurence noted the
party <i>en route</i> to refreshments, Madeline<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
and Lord Montycute bringing up the
rear. She belonged to another world
than his, there was no room in her life
for him and Harry. As he had chafed in
Lady Rachel’s chains, he had caught
snatches of the conversation of the butterflies
who fluttered round his wife. He
heard of balls, river parties, rides, picnics.
He was aware that Miss West’s
society was in immense demand; he
caught one laughing announcement “that
she had four engagements for the next
evening, and not a spare hour for the
next three weeks.”</p>

<p>Not long after that, as he and a friend
were walking down to Parsons Green
station, they were passed by a splendid
carriage, which gave a glimpse of two
frothy-looking parasols, and two tall hats.</p>

<p>“There goes Miss West,” explained
his companion, “the Australian heiress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
and beauty, with Lord Tony on the back
seat. I hear it is quite settled, they are
to be married in the autumn.”</p>

<p>“Are they? Who is your authority?”</p>

<p>“I can’t say; it’s in the air. I wonder
she was not snapped up, long ago, for
although old West is about as common
as they make ’em, yet every one allows
that his daughter is charming.”</p>

</div>


<p>The first opportunity that Madeline could
find she ventured a visit to the Holts. It
was a lovely June morning as she walked
up to the front entrance of the sequestered
Farm. She found Harry—<i>her</i> Harry, a
pretty little fellow with fair soft hair and
surprised dark eyes, sitting alone upon
the doorstep, and nursing a pointer pup.
It was useless for her to ask in her
most winning manner—</p>

<p>“Harry dear, don’t you know me?
Darling, I am your own mother; your
own mummy!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>Harry simply frowned and shook his
curls, and clutched the puppy tightly in
his clasp as if he meant to throttle it.</p>

<p>Presently Mrs. Holt came upon the
scene, with turned-up sleeves, and stout
bare arms, fresh from the dairy. She
was exceedingly civil, and exceedingly
cool; invited Miss West into the little
parlour, dusted a chair for her, and did
her best to soften the rigidity and hauteur
of little Harry’s aspect.</p>

<p>After some conversation about his
double teeth, the weather, and Nice, she
said—</p>

<p>“Suppose you and he just go round
the garden, ma’am, and make friends.
I’ll leave you to yourselves, whilst I go
and see after the dinner.”</p>

<p>“But pray don’t get anything extra
for <i>me</i>, Mrs. Holt,” implored Madeline.
“Just what you have yourselves. I shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
be very angry if you make a stranger
of me.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Holt muttered some incoherent
reply, and went away saying to herself—</p>

<p>“Not make a stranger of you! and
what else? Not make any difference for
you! I’m thinking you’d look very glum
if I were to set you down to beans and
bacon, my grand young London madame.
Dear me, but she <i>is</i> changed! She
cannot stir without a sound of rustling;
and the price of one of her rings would
build a new barn!”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Harry and his mother went
round the garden as desired, hand-in-hand.
He could talk very plainly for
his age, and trotted along by her
side, considerably thawed in manner.
This process was due to a lovely ball
she had unexpectedly produced, a gay
picture-book, and a packet of candy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
He chattered away in a most friendly
style, and showed her the pigeons, the
bees, and where the lark was buried—in
fact, all what he considered the lions of
the place; and every moment unfolded
to his delighted companion some additional
marvel and charm.</p>

<p>By the time that one-o’clock dinner
was ready, the couple were on excellent
terms, and he had even gone so far as
to kiss her, and to put his little holland-clad
arms round her neck of his own
accord. The sensation was extremely
pleasant.</p>

<p>After dinner—<i>not</i> consisting of beans
and bacon—Mrs. Holt and her guest
had a long <i>tête-à-tête</i>. The condition of
Harry’s health was first disposed of,
then the state of his wardrobe came
under discussion.</p>

<p>“I should tell you, ma’am, since you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
ask, that all the lovely frocks and pelisses
you sent from France are just laying
there. Mr. Wynne won’t allow him to
wear one of them, nor anything you gave
him.”</p>

<p>“And why not, pray?” demanded the
young lady with considerably heightened
colour.</p>

<p>“He told me quite serious, one day,”
said Mrs. Holt, now speaking with ill-suppressed
satisfaction, “that what he
had worn and <i>was</i> wearing, as you gave
him, he might wear out; but no new
things were to be accepted, as you had
nothing to do with the child now. So I
put them all by, just as they came, in the
front room wardrobe, and there they are.”</p>

<p>“What does he mean?” asked Madeline,
in a sharp key.</p>

<p>“I’m sure, ma’am, <i>you</i> know better
than I do; he said as he had no objection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
to your seeing the child, now and then,
but that was all. I expect Mr. Wynne
can be real stiff and determined,” smoothing
out her apron with an air of solemn
disapproval, not of him, but of her visitor.</p>

<p>Madeline said nothing, but she felt a
good deal. Mrs. Holt, from her manner
more than from her words, sat in judgment
upon her. She, this wife of a
common farmer, actually dared to criticise
the beautiful and admired and spoiled
Miss West.</p>

<p>“You see, ma’am,” she continued,
“you are, and you are not, the child’s
mother. He does not recognize you as
that—I mean the child himself—you have
kept away too long. In course you can’t
be in two places at once, nor be both
Miss West and Mrs. Wynne. ’Tisn’t my
wish, nor my own doing, as I have taken
your place with the child. He is main<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
fond of me. And then, poor Mr. Wynne,
he felt your leaving him at first, no
doubt of that; but he is getting over it
now; men haven’t as much feeling as we
<i>think</i>.”</p>

<p>Madeline listened with a guilty conscience,
every word went home to her
with as much force as a blow. She had
chosen her line, and she must stick to
single blessedness. There was to be no
going back, at any rate at present.</p>

<p>This conviction made her reckless, and
she rushed with eagerness into the full
tide of London gaiety with a passionate
desire to escape from the past, to get
away from the clamouring of a still
articulate conscience, to annihilate
memory by some great and effective
action, and to be happy! But memory
was not so easily stifled, and now that
Laurence had disappeared from her life—such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
is the contrariness of humanity—she
wished him back. At times, at races,
at Hurlingham, in great assemblies, at
the theatre, or in the Row, she searched
the crowds for him in vain. Mrs. Leach,
who was her constant companion and
self-elected chaperon, reading her young
friend by the light of her own memories,
noticed that she was not like other girls,
content and happy with her company and
surroundings. There was a restlessness
in her manner; she seemed to be continually
looking for some one—some one
who never came, who was never to be seen.</p>

<p>Madeline preferred Lady Rachel’s, or
Mrs. Lorimer’s company to the splendid
widow’s society, and made futile efforts
to shake off her shackles—efforts which
were vain.</p>

<p>Yes, among all Madeline’s social successes,
in the midst of her most dazzling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
triumphs, she ever cast a glance around
in search of Laurence. Surely, if he
went to see her in the full blaze of her
triumph, he would think twice ere he
permanently renounced such a treasure!
She felt hot and angry when she thought
of him, but nevertheless she longed to see
him once more—odious, unreasonable,
and tyrannical as he was. Surely he
did not mean to abandon her in reality.
That idea had no place in her mind when
she was abroad. There everything and
everybody seemed different. It was easy,
in a strange country, far away from
Laurence and Harry, to drop a misty
cloud over the past, and to feel as if she
really <i>was</i> Miss West. But here in
London, where she had lived as a married
woman, and had struggled—and oh, what
a struggle!—with the awful question of
how to support a household on nothing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
the idea was unnatural—nay, it went
further, it was improper. She would
perhaps write to him some day, and hold
out the olive branch; but not yet, and
meanwhile she must see him.</p>

<p>Mr. West was still extremely uneasy
about himself. He found the heat, and
dust, and noise of London trying to his
health, he declared; and, much to the
disgust of Mrs. Leach and other interested
friends, he announced that the middle of
July would not find him in England.
He was going to Carlsbad, to Switzerland,
and to winter abroad—probably at
Biarritz.</p>

<p>Ere she was thus carried off, Madeline
resolved to see Laurence. She prevailed
upon Lady Rachel to take her to the
Temple church. She was aware that he
went there every Sunday, and Lady
Rachel, little guessing the reason of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
friend’s sudden enthusiasm for the venerable
edifice, and anxiety to hear a certain
well-known preacher, procured two tickets
for benchers’ seats, and occupied them the
ensuing sabbath.</p>

<p>These seats were roomy and elevated,
and commanded an excellent view of the
whole centre of the church where the
members of the various inns sat. They
came in gradually, not in legal garb,
as Madeline had half expected, but in
their usual dress; and she strained her
eyes so eagerly that her sharp little
friend nudged her and said, “For whom
are you looking, Maddie?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no one,” colouring. “It is such
a very interesting old place. I like
staring about. What crowds of people
who cannot get seats, and have to stand!”</p>

<p>At this juncture the organ pealed out,
and every one stood up as the choir filed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
in, and just immediately afterwards, Lady
Rachel exclaimed in an excited whisper,
“There’s Mr. Wynne—look!”</p>

<p>Of course Madeline never moved her
eyes from him; they followed him, as he
found a seat at the end of a pew, luckily
well within her view. He could not see
her, but she could study him, especially
when she knelt down, with her two hands
shielding either side of her face, from
watchful Lady Rachel.</p>

<p>He looked well, a little grave perhaps,
a little worn; no doubt he was working
hard. He did not stare about as did
others, nor cast a single glance at the
radiant figure in the benchers’ seats. At
times he seemed preoccupied and buried
in thought, but he gave his undivided
attention to the sermon, to which he
listened with folded arms and a critical
air, as if he were weighing every word of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
it in his mind, and as though it were
a summing up of evidence being laid
before a jury of which he was a member.
There was no abstracted air about him,
his mind was on the alert, he had cast
the past or future aside, and was absorbed
in the present.</p>

<p>The sermon concluded, crowds flocked
through the ancient doorway, and scattered
outside. Lady Rachel still lingered,
and looked about eagerly, ere
taking her departure westward, and then
she exclaimed, in a disgusted voice—</p>

<p>“I wanted to have asked Mr. Wynne
to lunch, if I had seen him to speak
to,” shaking out her parasol and opening
it with a jerk of annoyance. “But
there he goes, marched off by that girl
in the green and blue frock—the very
sight of it turns me cold! And do you
see the old papa rushing after them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
and accosting him with rapture? The
way in which girls throw themselves at
men’s heads nowadays, is abominable.
However, it’s a mistake for these bold
creatures to imagine that men will marry
them. They either take a wife from the
stage or music-hall, or some quiet little
country mouse. As for Mr. Wynne, he
is a widower, and I believe his wife was
a perfect <i>horror</i>—so he will not be caught
again! Ah, here’s a hansom! Now, my
dear girl, get in, get in. These dry
sermons make me frightfully thirsty. I
am dying for my lunch.”</p>

<p>The house in Belgrave Square remained
closed for many months, whilst its master
roamed from one fashionable continental
resort to another, in search of what he
called health—but which was merely
another name for variety and amusement.
Madeline was at first averse to this protracted
absence; but she had excellent
news of little Harry. Laurence was still
in what she called “the sulks;” and every
day weakened her hold more and more
on her former ties, and bound her to her
present condition. In the early twenties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
a girl is very adaptable, and it had come
to this, that at times Miss West forgot
that she had ever had other than this
sunny butterfly existence; and, if her conscience
occasionally made a claim on
behalf of her child, she promptly told
herself that he was well cared for, and
that Lady Frederick Talboys sent all
her children out to nurse until they were
three years of age, and Harry was barely
two. As for Laurence, he would come
to his senses in time; and the idea of
telling her father of her marriage she
now put away in the lumber-room of her
brain, and rarely looked at.</p>

<p>About Christmas Mr. and Miss West
and suite arrived at Biarritz, put up
at a large and fashionable hotel, and
occupied the best rooms on the first
floor. They found Biarritz charming,
Madeline liked the sea, the rolling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
Atlantic breakers, the Basque tongue,
and the bronzed semi-Spanish peasantry.
Mr. West was charmed with the society,
the golf links, and the Casino.</p>

<p>One day Mrs. Leach casually arrived
at their hotel, with a number of basket-trunks
and a maid, looking very handsome,
and was enchanted to meet dearest
Madeline and dear Mr. West. She had
heard that they were at Pau, and was so
surprised to discover them. Madeline
was such a naughty girl about writing,
such a hopelessly lazy correspondent.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, Miss West was
secretly anxious to shake off the tenacious
widow, and was purposely silent.</p>

<p>In less than a week the lady had
resumed her sway over Madeline’s papa.
Her soft manners, pathetic eyes, stately
presence, and low, caressing voice, proved
his undoing. He had almost forgotten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
the Honourable Mrs. Leach—and here,
in three days, he was as much, or more,
her slave as ever. So much for men’s
vanity and women’s wiles. She flattered—he
confided. It came to pass, as a
matter of course, that the lady occupied a
seat beside Madeline in the landau every
afternoon. Her maid tripped down with
her wraps and parasol precisely as if it
were her mistress’s own carriage. Her
mistress also occupied Miss West’s private
sitting-room, received her friends in it,
wrote, and worked, and read all the Wests’
papers and books, shared their table at
meals in the <i>salle à manger</i>, and (but
this was never known to Madeline) her
little weekly account for room and board
was always furnished to and settled by
Madeline’s papa; a few whispered words
on the balcony one night had arranged
this trifling matter. The handsome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
widow was completely identified with
the West family, and was included in
all their invitations as well as their
accounts. Every evening, after dinner,
she and Mr. West sat aloof in a little
alcove whilst he smoked cigarettes, or
on the verandah whilst he smoked and
sipped his coffee, and she amused him
and cut up many of the gay and unsuspicious
company for his delectation. She
was also confidential respecting her own
affairs. If she had told him their true
position his few scanty locks would have
stood on end. She was almost at the
end of her wits, and he was her sole hope,
her last resource. For years she had
lived beyond her income—a small one.
Her dressmaker’s bills would have
staggered even him. She owed money
in all directions; her creditors were
pressing, her society friends were not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
pressing with invitations; her husband’s
connections ignored her. But if she
could establish herself in Mr. West’s
heart and home, as his second wife, she
would have before her a new and delightful
career. And she had begun well!
Certainly Madeline was irresponsive and
cool, but always pleasant and polite.
Why was Madeline changed? However,
once she was Madeline’s mamma, Madeline
would find a difference! Every
night, as Mrs. Leach stepped into the lift,
to be borne aloft to her own bower, she
said to herself, “He will certainly propose
to-morrow,” but alas! one evening these
cheering presentiments were crushed.</p>

<p>The conversation had turned upon
Madeline. She was a favourite subject
with her father.</p>

<p>“She nursed me well and pulled me
through that nasty illness last winter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
I shall never forget her. One would
have said she was accustomed to nursing—and
nursing a man too, ha, ha! I
should miss her terribly if she married.”</p>

<p>“But there is no prospect of that at
present, is there?” asked his listener
softly.</p>

<p>“No. She is too stand-off. She will
ride and dance, and talk and laugh, but
once a man’s attentions become marked,
she freezes up! I’m afraid she is serious
when she says she won’t marry. There’s
Lord Tony hanging after her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t you think he is very much
<i>épris</i> with Miss Teale of New York?”</p>

<p>“Not he!” impatiently. “I dare say
he and Madeline will settle it some day.”</p>

<p>“And then how lonely you will be,
dear Mr. West! <i>I</i> know what it is like.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose it will be a little dull,
unless the young people will live with me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>“Oh!” rather sharply, “they won’t
do <i>that</i>!”</p>

<p>“If they don’t, I shall have to set up
another housekeeper, to get some one to
take pity on me and marry again,” and
he looked significantly into Mrs. Leach’s
unabashed eyes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Leach held her breath.</p>

<p>“But I should never dream of doing
that as long as Madeline is with me.”</p>

<p>“So here was the matter in a nutshell,”
said his listener to herself, as she grasped
her fan fiercely and closed her lips.
Unless Madeline went off, he would never
marry. The great thing, of course, was
to get the girl settled. She passed her
obvious admirers in lightning review.
There was actually not one whom she
could lay her finger upon as a possible son-in-law
for the little gentleman beside her.
She knew several who would have gladly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
proposed to Madeline, but Madeline
never gave them a chance. Why? She
would make it her business to discover
the reason why Miss Madeline was so
cold and <i>difficile</i>, and to find out <i>who</i> he
was? Mr. Jessop knew. Oh, if she only
had a chance of exercising her fascination
on that sour-looking barrister! Madeline
had had a note from him recently, and
she had been on the point of perusing it
when she had been disturbed: she frequently
mistook Madeline’s letters for her
own, and had glanced over a good deal
of her correspondence. It had proved
extremely commonplace, but she felt
confident that Mr. Jessop’s letter would
be of absorbing interest.</p>

<p>Madeline was on the alert. She had
taken a sincere dislike to this tall,
dashing body-guard of hers, with her
splendid toilettes, shocking meannesses,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
her soft manners, and her sharp claws.
She was aware that she tampered with her
letters. She had surprised her (but not
discovered herself); and seen her carry a
piece of recently-used blotting-paper and
hold it up before the sitting-room mirror;
and she was aware, from Josephine, that
Mrs. Leach had made an exhaustive
search in her room, under pretence of
seeking a fur collarette. Oh! she was
a clumsy spy.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In March, when the English season
was as its height, and every hotel and
villa was packed, an elderly Englishwoman,
wearing blue spectacles, and a
small sandy-haired girl, wearing a tailor-made
and sailor hat—that seal of British
livery—toiled up the staircase of the
Grand Hotel, followed by their luggage.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
At the first landing the young lady
stopped and stared at a very smart
apparition which had just come out of a
sitting-room—a pretty, tall girl, dressed
with much elegance in a plum-coloured
cloth coat and skirt, a white cloth waistcoat,
white felt hat with purple velvet,
white gloves, white sunshade. Could it
be possible that she was Madeline West?
Madeline, the pupil-teacher at Mrs.
Harper’s? She raised her eyes: yes, it
<i>was</i> Madeline. She would speak.</p>

<p>“Madeline—West, I am sure. Don’t
you remember me at school—Nina
Berwick?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, of course,” shaking hands.</p>

<p>“Growing up makes a difference,
doesn’t it?” (Growing rich makes a
difference too.)</p>

<p>“You are staying here?” said Miss
Berwick effusively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, we have been here ever since
Christmas.”</p>

<p>“How nice! I hope we shall see a
great deal of one another, and have talks
over old times.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Madeline, colouring,
“that will be charming.”</p>

<p>“You are not married, are you,
Madeline?”</p>

<p>“What has put such an idea into your
head?” was the misleading reply.
Madeline was clever at evasion and
subterfuge: practice makes perfect.</p>

<p>“You see we have been living abroad
for two years, and are rather out of the
way of news. I am living with my
aunt, Lady Fitzsandy. She hates
England. Well, I’m nearly dead, and
very dusty and thirsty. Our rooms are on
the <i>quatrième étage</i>, and the lift is out
of order, I hear, so I must toil up.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
Ta-ta!” and she hurried away after the
porters and her relative.</p>

<p>Nina Berwick had left school just after
the breaking-up—Madeline recalled this
with a sensation of relief. She came
from the borders of Scotland, and knew
nothing; besides, she was always intensely
stupid, and never could remember anything—names,
dates, historical events,
and even school events went through her
sieve-like brain. She had not been a
particular friend of Madeline’s, and had
only known her in those days when she
had fallen from her high estate—never
as the rich Miss West.</p>

<p>For her part, Nina Berwick was amazed
at her friend’s transformation. She occupied
a suite on the first floor. She had
an English footman, a private sitting-room,
a Paris frock, and yet she was
not married! The Miss Berwicks were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
well-born but poor; their aunt could not
afford them the delights of a London
season. She carried them abroad, where
they had never heard of Madeline’s social
successes. Lady Fitzsandy roved about
the Continent, from one gay centre to
another, and was extremely anxious to
get her nieces settled—especially Lucy,
who was plain and twenty-eight.</p>

<p>Lady Fitzsandy gladly foregathered
with Mr. West’s pleasant party. They
always joined forces after dinner in the
hall, and took coffee together. And her
ladyship was specially charmed with Mrs.
Leach, Miss West’s chaperon, who was
so sweet and so handsome—she was connected,
too, with her own cousins the
Horse-Leaches—and seemed so pleased
and interested to hear that Nina had
been at school with Miss West.</p>

<p>“The dear girls,” as she pointed out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
the pair sitting side by side on a distant
divan, “were going over old times three
years ago, and talking so happily together.”
This is what they were saying,
and what Mrs. Leach would have given
her best ring to hear:—</p>

<p>“And so your father came home very
wealthy, Maddie? And you live in
London, and have had two seasons, and
go everywhere—and know everybody?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know about that.”</p>

<p>“Well, of course, you have hosts of
admirers.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that either!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, I’m sure you have had
hundreds. What was the name of that
gentleman at school?”</p>

<p>“Gentleman at school—there were no
gentlemen—at school.”</p>

<p>“Now don’t be silly! He was the
friend of some people that used to come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
to the breaking-up. He danced with
you, and Miss Selina was wild. I’m
sure you must remember him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want, as you may easily
imagine, to remember anything about
<i>school</i>, except,” picking herself up, “some
of my school-fellows.”</p>

<p>“Oh, now, let me see, I’ve a shocking
memory for names. I think his name
began with N, or was there an N in it?”</p>

<p>“There was <i>nothing</i> in it—will that
answer as well. There is to be a big ball
here to-morrow; you are just in time.”</p>

<p>“In the hotel?”</p>

<p>“Yes; it will be a capital dance.”</p>

<p>“But I know no men.”</p>

<p>“I know any number, and I will get
you partners,” said Madeline, recklessly.</p>

<p>And Madeline kept her word, to the
intense enjoyment of Miss Berwick, who,
thanks to her school-fellow, had quite a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
delightful plurality of cavaliers. It
seemed so strange to Nina Berwick to
see Madeline West, the shabby drudge
whom she had pitied at school, now
surrounded with every luxury and crowds
of smart acquaintances, with a carriage
and servants at her orders, and all the
best <i>partis</i> at her feet.</p>

<p>She was extremely good-natured, and
did her utmost to give this rather plain,
dull little spinster a good time. She
got up picnics and golf tournaments.
She took her for long drives and pleasant
expeditions.</p>

<p>One afternoon Miss Berwick’s grandmamma
and Mrs. Leach remained at
home, had tea together, and talked Miss
West over in her own sitting-room. Lady
Fitzsandy liked Miss West, and sang her
praises in a mild key; ditto Mrs. Leach,
in a yet louder strain, with one occasional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
piercing high note—that note a “but.”
“But she is wildly extravagant; but she
is wonderful, considering her antecedents;
but she cannot live without excitement;
but she is uncertain in her friendships.”</p>

<p><i>But</i> Lady Fitzsandy was staunch, and
said, “I must say that, as far as I can
judge, Miss West is true to old friends.
She is very much attached to Nina.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Leach, on her own part, professed
a rival attachment for Miss Berwick,
gave her autographs—which she was
collecting—also a box of pralines, and
took her arm round the gardens once,
treated her to coffee at the Casino, and
there pumped her to the best of her
ability.</p>

<p>“And so Madeline was only a pupil-teacher
when you were at school, you
tell me, dear?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I was there fourteen months, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
finishing. I was among the elders, and
she had charge of the small fry; I did
not come across her at classes or in
school hours, but I used to meet her in
passages, and in the boot-room, and
sometimes we waltzed together on half
holidays. I always liked Maddie.”</p>

<p>“And you left before her?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I left last Christmas three
years, after the breaking-up dance. I
recollect Maddie played, to save the
old skinflints a guinea. But the end of
the evening she danced with a man
several times, and Miss Selina was
furious; I think he admired Madeline,
and that was her reason.”</p>

<p>“And what was his name, darling?”</p>

<p>“I really cannot remember. I asked
Madeline about him, and she rather
snubbed me; but it was something
beginning with an N, I think.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>Oh, what a tiresome, stupid creature!
“You cannot recollect, darling?”</p>

<p>“No; except that there was an N in
his name! I am sure of that.”</p>

<p>“And so Madeline remained on for a
year; and did you never hear <i>anything</i>
more of the school after you left?”</p>

<p>“Yes; let me see, I did hear something,
I may have dreamt it, that some
one was expelled.”</p>

<p>“Expelled!” with a slight start.
“Dear me, how shocking!”</p>

<p>“I cannot recollect, but I am sure it
was not Madeline. She was not that
sort of girl; and I may have read it in
a book. I get so mixed between what I
have heard and what I have read about;
but I am awfully absent and dreamy.”</p>

<p>“Have you kept up a correspondence
with any of your school-fellows?”</p>

<p>“Oh no! I hate letter-writing; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
I detested school. But I always liked
Maddie West. She was so pretty to look
at, so pleasant to talk to, so good-natured.
And she is not a bit changed.
She is a dear.”</p>

<p>“There never was any—you never
heard of <i>her</i> getting into any scrape at
school, did you?”</p>

<p>“Oh no; what a funny idea—a scrape!
Why, Maddie was as strict about the
rules as the Harpies themselves!”</p>

<p>“And this gentleman that admired
her?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it was only at our dances, the
breakings-up; he never gave her a second
thought.”</p>

<p>So Mrs. Leech had wasted her blandishments,
her time, and her money all for
nothing on this half-witted, tow-headed
girl. When she realized the fact, she
rose rather abruptly—looking surprisingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
sour, paid at the <i>comptoir</i>, and led the
way back to the promenade in somewhat
gloomy silence.</p>

<p>The Berwicks went on to Pau a few
days later, and were lost sight of once
more, as is the usual way with these
wandering birds of passage.</p>

</div>


<p>Mr. West returned home early in the
season, and inaugurated his arrival with
new horses, new liveries, new footmen,
and gave a series of most <i>recherché</i>
dinners. He would have bidden Mr.
Wynne to one of these banquets, for the
old gentleman had a tenacious memory
(especially for things that his daughter
expressly wished he would forget), but
she quietly turned the subject; and did
not encourage the idea of entertaining
her husband under her unsuspicious
parent’s roof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>“But he belongs to my club, The
Foolscap. I see him there now and then,
and he seems a popular chap, and to
know every one. I heard Fotherham—Lord
Fotherham—pressing him to spend
a couple of days with them up the river,
and they say his articles and writings
are quite popular.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t think literary people are
very interesting; you have always to get
up all their works, and be able to stand
a stiff examination in them, if you want
to invite them here. Did you see the
failure of a great bank in Australia—it
was among the telegrams in the <i>Echo</i>
this evening?” she added artfully.</p>

<p>“No. Bless my soul! what bank?
Where is the paper?” in great excitement.
And Mr. West’s mind was hurried away
into another channel, and Mr. Wynne’s
invitation-card was not despatched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>Madeline found time to pay many
stealthy visits to Harry, who was really
a beautiful child, of whom even the most
indifferent mother might well feel proud.
He could talk and walk so nicely, and
was such a pretty, endearing little fellow,
that her visits, from being spasmodic and
irregular, became of weekly occurrence.</p>

<p>Impunity had emboldened her, and
every Saturday morning, when her father
imagined her to be shopping, or in the
Park—found her in Mrs. Holt’s old-fashioned
garden, walking and playing
between high hollyhocks, sunflowers, and
lavender bushes, with a fair-haired little
boy. What would Mr. West have said
had he seen his lovely daughter running
round and round, and up and down the
gravel path, driven by two knotted reins,
and a small fierce driver, wielding a long
whip with a whistle at the end of it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Wynne never met, for her
days, as we have seen, were Saturdays,
and his were invariably Sundays.</p>

<p>Low fever was prevalent that sultry
month of June, also typhoid and diphtheria.
The latter fastened its grim clutch
on little Harry. It was a case which
developed rapidly. The child had been
hot and heavy, and not his usual bright
talkative self, when his mother saw him
on Saturday. Mrs. Holt attributed this
entirely to the oppressive weather, and
to thunder in the air. On Sunday his
father, justly alarmed, summoned the
local doctor, who at once pronounced
that the little patient was a victim to
diphtheria.</p>

<p>On Monday Madeline was sent for.
The child was a shade better, though
still very ill. He lay in his cot and
gazed at her with large distended eyes—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
gasped out “Mummy—mummy,” as
he held out his little hot hands.</p>

<p>She remained all day, for it so happened
that her father was out of town;
but, under any circumstances, she assured
herself, she would have stayed all the
same; and when she finally departed,
late in the evening, the patient was
sleeping, and the doctor’s opinion more
encouraging. He assured her that she
need not alarm herself, as he walked
down with her to where the fly stood
waiting in the lane.</p>

<p>“You really need not be uneasy, my
dear madam,” he said impressively, “unless
things take a most unexpected turn,
and then, of course, we will let you know.
He is a fine healthy child, and admirably
nursed by yonder good woman,” nodding
towards the house.</p>

<p>“She is indeed a good woman!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
returned Madeline fervently, as her
thoughts recalled Mrs. Holt’s unwearying
care and night and day attendance on
her nursling. She even seemed to grudge
her permission to feed him, or to moisten
his lips.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I can’t come to-morrow,
unless I am really needed,” said Madeline
plaintively. “You say there is no
danger now—you are <i>sure</i>? I may rely
on you to tell me?”</p>

<p>“Yes; there is none whatever at present.”</p>

<p>“Because if there were, I should
remain all night.”</p>

<p>“There is no occasion, especially if
you are urgently needed elsewhere,”
rejoined the doctor, who nevertheless
thought it rather strange that this
pretty, tearful, agitated young lady
should not find it the most natural thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
to remain with her sick child—her only
child.</p>

<p>Promising that she should have early
news the next morning by telegraph, he
handed her into the fly, and bowed her
off the scene, just as another inquiring
relative—equally near and equally
anxious—came hurrying up to him—in
fact, the child’s father, who had taken
the short cut from the station by the
path across the fields.</p>

<p>“Most peculiar state of affairs,” thought
the doctor to himself; “there must be a
screw loose somewhere. The child’s
parents apparently well-off, fashionable
people, living apart and visiting the farm
separately, and never alluding to one
another. What did it mean?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Holt promptly set the matter
before him in three words. It meant
that “they had quarrelled.” Mr. Wynne<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
remained at the farmhouse all night,
sharing Mrs. Holt’s vigil, and watching
every turn, every movement, every
breath of the little sleeper as anxiously
as she did herself. In the morning there
was no positive change one way or
another. The pendulum of little Harry’s
existence seemed to have paused for a
time before it made that one vital
movement in the direction of either life
or death.</p>

<p>A message was despatched to Miss
West in these laconic words—“Slept
pretty well; much the same.” And
Madeline, relieved in her mind, entered
on the work of a long and toilsome day.
In short, she continued the grand preparations
for a ball that they were giving
that evening. It was to be the ball of
the season.</p>

<p>Invitations had been out for four weeks.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
A native Indian prince, and some of the
lesser Royalties had signified their intention
of being present. Mr. West looked
upon the festivity as the supreme occasion
of his life, the summit of his ambition—fully
and flawlessly attained—and he
was happy. Only, of course, there is a
thorn in every rose; in this rose there
were two thorns. One—and a very sharp
one—the disquieting rumours of financial
affairs in Australia, where a great part of
his huge income was invested; and the
other and lesser thorn—the announcement
of Lord Tony’s engagement to
an old acquaintance and partner, Miss
Pamela Pace.</p>

<p>And so his dream of calling Lord Tony
by his Christian name, as his son-in-law,
was at an end. However, he was resolved
to make the most of the delightful
present, and to give an entertainment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
the fame of which should ring from one
end of London to the other. He fully
carried out his motto, “money no object.”
The floral decorations alone for hall,
staircase, ballrooms, and supper-table
came to the pretty penny of two thousand
pounds. The favourite band of the
season was, of course, in attendance. As
to the supper, it was to be a banquet,
the menu of which would make an
epicure green with envy; and Madeline’s
dress was to come direct from Doucet,
and had been specially designed for the
occasion by Mr. West’s commands.</p>

<p>With all these splendid preparations in
view, it will be easily understood that it
was with some trepidation that Madeline
asked her father to postpone the ball.</p>

<p>She made her request very timidly,
with failing heart and faltering lips—indeed,
the end of her sentence died away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
in the air when she beheld the terrible
expression on her parent’s face.</p>

<p>“Put off the ball!” he roared; “are
you mad? You must have a shingle short.
Put off the swells, after all the work I’ve
had to get them! Put off”—he actually
choked over the words—“the Shah-da-shah,
when you <i>know</i> there’s not another
day in the season! Every night is taken.
Why, what do you mean? What’s your
reason?” he almost screamed.</p>

<p>“I—I thought the intense heat—I
fancied Ascot—races happening to-morrow,
and I’m not feeling very—well,”
she faltered lamely.</p>

<p>“Oh, bosh! You look as fit as possible.
Your reasons are no reasons. I suppose
you are cut up about Tony—though why
you should be is more than I can say—seeing
that you refused him twice.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, I’m delighted at his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
engagement. Pamela Pace is, as you
know, a friend of mine. He promised
to bring her to the dance without
fail.”</p>

<p>“And the dance comes off on Wednesday
without fail.”</p>

<p>The suggestion of its postponement
had been made on Monday—after her
return from the farm.</p>

<p>“And remember, Madeline, that I
shall expect you to stir yourself—look
after the decorations, have an eye to the
supper-tables, and see that the men do
the floors properly, and that there are no
old waltzes in the programme. You will
have your work cut out, and I mine. It
will be the busiest day in your life—one
to talk of and look back on when you are
a grandmother. It’s not a common event
to entertain the Shah-da-shah!” As he
said this he jumped up and began to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
pace the room, rubbing his hands, in
an ecstasy of anticipation.</p>

<p>On the morning of the ball Mr. West
was early about, arranging, ordering,
superintending, and sending telegrams.</p>

<p>“Here’s a pile,” he suddenly exclaimed
at breakfast-time, indicating a heap of
letters. “I got these all yesterday from
people asking for invitations—invitations
for themselves, cousins, aunts, and so on,
from folk who wouldn’t know us last
season; but it’s my turn now! I’ll have
none of them. Whatever else the ball will
be, it shall be select,” waving his arm
with a gesture that was ludicrous in its
pomposity. “By the way, that fellow
Wynne—he belongs to my club, you know—and
besides that, Bagge and Keepe
have given him a brief in a case I’m
much concerned in. You remember him,
eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I remember Mr. Wynne,” she
answered rather stiffly.</p>

<p>“Well, I met him in the street
yesterday morning, and asked him for
to-morrow. He’s a presentable-looking
sort of chap,” nodding rather apologetically
at his daughter; “but, would you
believe it, he would not come; though
I told him it would be something out of
the common. And fancy his reason”—pausing
dramatically—the little man was
still pacing the room—“you will never
guess; you will be as astounded as I was.
He said his child was ill.”</p>

<p>Madeline never raised her eyes, but sat
with them fixed upon a certain pattern
on the carpet, not looking particularly
interested, merely indifferent, white and
rigid.</p>

<p>“He appeared quite in a fright,” proceeded
Mr. West, volubly, “and very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
much worried and put out. He had a
case on in court, and wanted to get
away. I had no idea that he was a
married man; had you?”</p>

<p>Before Mr. Wynne’s wife’s dry lips
could frame an appropriate answer to
this awkward question, a footman entered
with another bundle of notes on a salver,
and thus Mr. West’s attention was diverted
from his unhappy daughter.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII.<br><span class="small">“GONE OFF IN HER WHITE SHOES!”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>In due time all preparations were completed
for the reception of Mr. and Miss
West’s guests. The grand staircase was
lined with palm-trees and immense tropical
ferns, and lights were cunningly
arranged amid the dusky foliage; a fountain
of scent played at the head of this
splendid and unique approach, and here
stood the host and hostess side by side.</p>

<p>Mr. West was adorned in a plain evening
suit—(would, oh! would that he
might have decked himself with chains
and orders!)—and a perennial smile. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
daughter was arrayed in a French gown of
white satin and white chiffon, powdered
with silver. Diamonds shone on her
bodice, her neck, and in her hair. She
required no such adjuncts to set off
her appearance, but there they were!
Although tired and fagged, she looked
as superior to most of her lady guests—who
were chiefly of average everyday
prettiness—as a Eucharist lily to a single
dahlia. Her colour and eyes were exceptionally
bright, for she was flushed
by fatigue, excitement, and anxiety.</p>

<p>No news was good news, she told herself.
The last telegram was reassuring. There
was no need to fret and worry. Half
the miseries in the world are those that
have never happened! So she cast doubt
and care behind her as she took her
place in the state quadrille and prepared
to abandon herself to the occasion. No<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
one in their senses would suspect for a
moment that the beautiful, brilliant Miss
West had a care on her mind, much less
that her heart was aching with suspense
with regard to her sick child.</p>

<p>She indeed lulled her fears to sleep, and
played the part of hostess to perfection—not
dancing over much, as became the
lady of the house, till quite late in the
evening, or rather early in the morning,
and having a word—the right word—and
a smile for everybody.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The ball went off without a single
drawback. The most fastidious young
men avowed they had been “well done;”
the most critical chaperones could
detect no shortcomings in manners, partners,
or refreshments. People enjoyed
themselves; there was no after-supper
exodus; the men and maidens found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
that they were not bored, and changed
their minds about “going on.”</p>

<p>Yes, distinguished guests remained
unusually late. The supper, floor, and
arrangements were faultless; and Mr.
West was informed by one or two important
folk “that such an entertainment
reminded them of the Arabian Nights
for its magnificence. It was a ball of
balls.”</p>

<p>The little speculator was almost beside
himself with pride and self-satisfaction.
Truly those many cheques that had to
be drawn were already redeemed. He
must, of course, pay for his whistle; but
it was a pretty whistle, and worth its
price.</p>

<p>He unfolded his feelings to his daughter
as they stood alone in the big ballroom,
after the last guest had taken leave and
the carriages were rapidly rolling from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
the door. His sharp little eyes shone,
his mouth twitched, his hand actually
shook, not with champagne, but triumph.</p>

<p>“You did it splendidly, Maddie. If
you were a duchess you could not have
hit it off better! I often wonder where
you get your manners and air and way
of saying things. Your mother was
something of the same style, too. She
had real blue blood in her veins; but she
was not so sparkling as you are, though
very vivacious. I must say those Miss
Harpers did their duty by you. Well,”
looking round, “it’s all over. They are
putting out the candles, and there’s
broad daylight outside. It’s been a
success—a triumph! I wish some of my
old chums had seen it. Bless me, how
they would stare! A trifle better than
Colonial dances. And wouldn’t they like
to get hold of this in the Sydney <i>Bulletin</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
There’s a personal paper for you! I feel
a bit giddy. I expect I shall be knocked
up to-morrow—I mean to-day. Don’t
you rise before dinner-time. There’s the
sun streaming in. Get away to your
bed!”</p>

<p>Madeline had listened to this pæan of
triumphant complacency without any re-remark,
merely opening her mouth to
yawn, and yawn, and yawn. She was
very tired; and now that the stir and
whirl and excitement was over, felt ready
to collapse from sheer fatigue. She,
therefore, readily obeyed her parent’s
behest, and, kissing him on his wrinkled
cheek, walked off to her own room.</p>

<p>Josephine, half asleep, was sitting up
for her, the wax candles were guttering
in their sockets, the electric light was
struggling at the shutters with the sun.</p>

<p>“Oh, mademoiselle!” said the maid,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
rubbing her eyes, “I’ve been asleep, I
do believe. I’ve waited to unlace your
dress, though you said I need not; but
I know you could never do it yourself,”
beginning her task at once, whilst her
equally sleepy mistress stood before the
mirror and slowly removed her gloves,
bangles, and diamonds, and yawned at
her own reflection.</p>

<p>“It was splendid, mademoiselle. Jamais—pas
même à Paris—did I see such a
fête! I saw it well from a place behind
the band. What crowds, what toilettes!
but mademoiselle was the most charmante
of all. Ah! there is nothing like
a French dressmaker—and a good figure,
bien entendu. There were some costumes
that were ravishing in the ladies’
room. I helped. I saw them.”</p>

<p>“It went off well, I think, Josephine,
and papa is pleased; but I am glad that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
it is over,” said her mistress, wearily.
“Mind you don’t let me sleep later than
twelve o’clock on any account.”</p>

<p>“Twelve o’clock! and it is now six!”
cried Josephine in a tone of horror.
“Mademoiselle, you will be knocked up—you——”</p>

<p>“Oh! <i>what</i> is this?” interrupted her
mistress in a strange voice, snatching
up a telegram that lay upon a table, its
tan-coloured envelope as yet intact, and
which had hitherto been concealed by a
silver-backed hand-glass, as if it were of
no importance.</p>

<p>“Oh, I forgot! I fell asleep, you see.
It came for you at eleven o’clock last
night, just as the company were arriving,
and I could not disturb you. I hope it
is of no consequence.”</p>

<p>But, evidently, it was of great consequence,
for the young lady was reading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
it with a drawn, ghastly countenance,
and her hand holding the message shook
so much that the paper rattled as if in
a breeze of wind.</p>

<p>And this is what she was reading with
strained eyes. “Mrs. Holt to Miss
West, 9.30.—Come immediately; there
is a change.” And this was sent eight
hours ago.</p>

<p>“Josephine,” she said, with a look
that appalled the little Frenchwoman,
“why did you not give me this? It is
a matter of life and death. If—if,” with
a queer catch in her breath, “I am too
late, I shall never, never, never forgive
you! Here”—with a gesture of frenzy,
tearing off her dress—“take away this
rag and these hateful things,” dragging
the tiara out of her hair and flinging it
passionately on the floor, “for which I
have sold myself. Get me a common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
gown, woman. Quick, quick! and don’t
stand looking like a fool!”</p>

<p>Josephine had indeed been looking on
as if she was petrified, and asking herself
if her mistress had not suddenly gone
stark-staring mad? Mechanically she
picked up the despised ball-dress and
brought out a morning cotton, which
Madeline wrested from her hands and
flung over her head, saying—</p>

<p>“Send for a hansom—fly—fly!”</p>

<p>And thus exhorted and catching a spark
of the other’s excitement, she ran out
of the room and hurriedly dispatched a
heavy-eyed and amazed footman for the
cab, with many lively and impressive
gesticulations.</p>

<p>When she returned she found that
Madeline had already fastened her dress,
flung on a cape and the first hat she
could find, and, with a purse in one hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
and her gloves in another, was actually
ready. So was the hansom, for one had
been found outside, still lingering and
hoping for a fare. Madeline did not
delay a second. She ran downstairs
between the fading lights, the tropical
palms, the withering flowers, which had
had their one little day, and it was over.
Down she fled along the red-cloth carpetings,
under the gay awnings, and sprang
into the vehicle.</p>

<p>Josephine, who hurried after her, was
just in time to see her dash from the
door.</p>

<p>“Grand ciel!” she ejaculated to two
amazed men-servants, who now stood
beside her, looking very limp in the
bright summer morning. “Did any one
ever see the like of that? She has gone
away in her white satin ball-slippers.”</p>

<p>“What’s up? What’s the matter?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
demanded one of her companions authoritatively.
“What’s the meaning of
Miss West running out of the house as
if she was going for a fire-engine or the
police? Is she mad?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you. It was something
that she heard by telegram. Some one
is ill. She talked of life or death; she
is mad with fear of something. Oh, you
should have seen her eyes! She looked,
when she opened the paper, awful! I
thought she would have struck me because
I kept it back.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow, whatever it is, she could
not have gone before,” said the first
footman, with solemn importance. “But
what the devil can it be?” he added, as
he stroked his chin reflectively.</p>

<p>This was precisely the question upon
which no one could throw the least
glimmer of light; and, leaving the three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
servants to their speculations, we follow
Madeline down to the Holt. She caught
an early train. She was equally lucky
in getting a fly at the station (by bribing
heavily) and implored the driver to gallop
the whole way. She arrived at the farm
at eight o’clock, and rushed up the
garden and burst into the kitchen white
and breathless. But she was too late.
The truth came home to her with an
agonizing pang. She felt as if a dagger
had been thrust into her heart, for there
at the table sat Mrs. Holt, her elbows
resting on it, her apron thrown over her
head. She was sobbing long, long gasping
sobs, and looked the picture of grief.</p>

<p>Madeline shook as if seized with a
sudden palsy as she stood in the doorway.
Her lips refused to move or form
a sound; her heart was beating in her
very throat, and would assuredly choke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
her. She could not have asked a question
if her life depended on it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Holt, hearing steps, threw down
her apron and confronted her.</p>

<p>“Ay, I thought it might be you!”
she ejaculated in a husky voice. “Well,
it’s all over!... He died, poor darling,
at daybreak, in these arms!” holding out
those two hard-working extremities to
their fullest extent, with a gesture that
spoke volumes.</p>

<p>“I will not believe it; it is not true;
it—it is impossible!” broke in the
wretched girl. “The doctor said that
there was no danger. Oh, Mrs. Holt,
for God’s sake, I implore you to tell me
that you are only <i>frightening</i> me! You
think I have not been a good mother,
that I want a lesson, that—that—I
will see for myself,” hurrying across the
kitchen and opening a well-known door.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII">CHAPTER XXXVIII.<br><span class="small">DEATH AND SICKNESS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Alas! what was this that she beheld,
and that turned every vein in her body
to ice? It was death for the first time.
There before her, in the small cot, lay a
little still figure, with closed eyes and
folded hands, a lily between them; the
bed around it—yes, it was now <i>it</i>—already
strewn with white flowers, on
which the morning dew still lingered.
Who strews white flowers on the living?
Yes, Harry was dead! There was no
look of suffering now on the little brow;
he seemed as if he was sleeping; his soft<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
fair curls fell naturally over his forehead;
his long dark lashes swept his cheek.
He <i>might</i> be asleep! But why was he
so still? No breath, no gentle rising and
falling disturb his tiny crossed hands, so
lately full of life and mischief—and now!</p>

<p>With a low cry Madeline fell upon her
knees beside the child, and laid her lips
on his. How cold they were! But, no
he could not be dead! “Harry, Harry,”
she whispered. “Harry, I have come.
Open your eyes, darling, for me, only
<i>one</i> moment, and look at me, or I shall
go <i>mad</i>!”</p>

<p>“So you have come,” said a voice
close to her, and starting round she saw
Laurence, pale and haggard from a long
vigil, and stern as an avenging angel.
“It was hardly worthwhile now; there
is nothing to need your care any longer.
Poor little child! he is gone. He wanted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
you; he called as long as he could articulate
for his ‘mummy’—his ‘pretty, pretty
mummy.’” Here his faltering voice
broke, and he paused for a second, then
continued in a sudden burst of indignation.
“And whilst he was dying, his
mother was dancing!” glancing as he
spoke at her visible, and incriminating
white satin shoes.</p>

<p>“I only got the telegram this morning
at six o’clock,” returned Madeline with
awful calmness. The full reality had not
come home to her yet.</p>

<p>“You were summoned when the child
was first taken ill. Yes, I know you had
a great social part to play—that you
dared not be absent, that you dared not
tell your father that another, the holiest,
nearest, dearest of claims, appealed to
you,” pointing to the child. “You have
sacrificed us, you have sacrificed all, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
your Moloch—money. But it is not
fitting that I should reproach you here;
your conscience—and surely you are not
totally hardened—will tell you far sadder,
sterner truths than any human lips.”
She stood gazing at him vacantly, holding
the brass bar at the head of the bed
in both hands. “It may be some poor
consolation to you to know that, although
your presence would have been a comfort,
nothing could have saved him. From
the time the change set in last evening,
the doctor pronounced the case hopeless.”</p>

<p>Madeline still stood and looked at the
speaker as if she were in a trance, and
he, although he spoke with a certain sort
of deliberation, and as if he was addressing
one whose mind found it difficult to
grasp a subject, surveyed her with a pale
set face, and his eyes shone like a flame.</p>

<p>“There is no occasion for you to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
remain; I will make all arrangements.
The tie between us is severed: you and
I are as dead to one another as the child
is to us both. We have nothing now in
common but a grave.” His grief and
indignation left no room for pity.</p>

<p>Incidents which take some time to
describe, are occasionally almost instantaneous
in action. It was barely five
minutes since Madeline had entered the
farmhouse, and become aware of her loss,
and now she was looking with stony
eyes upon the destruction of everything
that in her inmost soul she valued. Her
child had wound himself into her heart.
He was dead; he had died in a stranger’s
arms, neglected by his own mother.
Laurence was also lost to her for ever!</p>

<p>“Have you nothing to say?” he asked
at last, as she still remained silent and
immovable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>She clutched the brass rail fiercely in
her grasp; there was a desperate expression
in her face. She looked like some
guilty, undefended prisoner, standing at
the bar of judgment.</p>

<p>“Have you no feeling, no words—nothing?”</p>

<p>Still she stared at him wildly—speechless.
He scrutinized her sharply. Her
lips were parched and open. There was
acute suffering in her pallid face, and
dazed, dilated eyes. And, before he had
time to realize what was about to happen,
she had fallen in a dead faint.</p>

<p>Mrs. Holt was hastily summoned, and
she was laid upon Mrs. Holt’s spare bed,
whilst burnt feathers were applied to her
nostrils; her hands were violently rubbed,
and every old-fashioned remedy was
exhausted. The farmer’s wife could
scarcely contain her resentment against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
this young woman, who had not deserved
to be the mother of her dead darling,
especially as she took notice of the
diamonds still glittering in her ears, and
of her white silk stockings and satin
shoes. These latter items outraged her
sense of propriety even more than Madeline’s
absence the previous night. She
lifted up one of these dainty slippers
from where it had fallen on the floor, as
its owner was being carried to bed, and
surveyed it indignantly.</p>

<p>“It’s danced a good lot, this ’ere shoe!
Look at the sole. Look at the satin,
there; it’s frayed, and it was new last
night, I’ll be bound! It’s a pretty little
foot, though; but you need not fear for
her, Mr. Wynne. It’s not grief as ails
her as much as you think. <i>She</i> never
was one as had much <i>feeling</i>—it’s just
dancing! She’s been on the floor the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
whole night, and she is just about done.”
And, tossing the miserable tell-tale shoe
indignantly to one side, she added, “It’s
dancing—not grief!”</p>

<p>When Madeline recovered consciousness,
she could not at first remember
where she was, but gradually the dreadful
truth dawned upon her mind; yet, strange
to say, she never shed one single tear.</p>

<p>“No; not one tear, as I live by
bread,” Mrs. Holt reported truthfully.
“Her face was as dry as a flint. Did
ever any one know the like?” The
worthy woman, who had wept copiously
herself, and whose eyes and nose testified
to the fact for days, did not know, had
never yet seen “the grief too deep for
tears.”</p>

<p>Madeline went—her husband having
returned to town—and locked herself into
the room, and sat alone with the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
corpse. Her sorrow was stony-eyed and
hard; her grief the worst of grief—the
loss of a child. And it was edged with
what gave it a searching and agonizing
point—remorse. Oh, that she might
have him back—half her life for half a
day—to look in his eyes, to whisper in
his ears! But those pretty brown eyes
were closed for ever; that little waxen
ear would never more listen to a human
voice. Surely she was the most unhappy
woman who ever walked the earth,
for to her was denied the comfort
of atonement! She had been weak,
wicked, unnatural; she had been a neglectful
mother to her poor little son. And
now, that she was yearning to be all that
a mother should, now that she would
verily give her life for his, it was too
late!</p>

<p>So long did she remain still and silent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
so long was there no sound, not even
of sobs, in that darkened room, that Mrs.
Holt became alarmed; and towards sundown
came authoritatively to the door
with loud knocks and a cup of tea.</p>

<p>“A fly had arrived to take her back to
the station. Mr. Wynne had ordered it,
and she must come out and have a cup
of tea and go. She would do no good to
any one by making herself ill.”</p>

<p>And, by reason of her importunities,
Mrs. Holt prevailed. The door was thrown
back, and Mrs. Wynne came out with a
face that—the farmer’s wife subsequently
described—fairly frightened her. She
had to stand over her and make her
drink the tea, and had all the work in the
world to prevail on her and coax her to
go back to town. No, she would remain;
she was determined to remain.</p>

<p>However, Mrs. Holt had a still more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
robust will, and gradually coaxed her
guest into returning home for just that
one night. Anyway, she must go and
fetch her clothes. She would be coming
for the funeral. Mr. Wynne had said
something about Friday. She could
return. Best go <i>now</i>.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Madeline, leaning
against the doorway from pure physical
weakness, and speaking in a curious,
husky voice. “I am going to tell my
father all, and I shall return to-morrow.”</p>

<p>And then she went reluctantly down
the walk, looking back over and over
again at a certain window with a drawn
blind, still wearing her white shoes—Mrs.
Holt’s were three sizes too large for her—and,
still without one single tear, she got
into the fly and was driven away.</p>

<p>When she returned to Belgrave Square—haggard,
distraught, and ghastly in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
colour—she found that Mr. West had
kept his room the whole day; that the
house had returned to its normal condition,
the palms and awnings were gone,
and “dinner was laid in the library.”
Thus she was blandly informed by the
butler as she passed upstairs, the butler
being far too gentlemanly a person to
even hint his amazement at her appearance
by look or tone.</p>

<p>But Miss West did not dine in the
library. She went to bed, which she
never left for six long weeks. Diphtheria
developed itself. The drains of 365,
Belgrave Square, were unjustly blamed.
Miss West had got a chill the night of
the dance, and it was known in society
that for many, many days the charming
hostess lay between life and death.</p>

<p>Josephine, a romantic and imaginative
Gaul, had long believed that her mistress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
had a secret love affair. She drew her
own inferences; she sympathized, and
she commanded the household to keep
silence respecting Miss West’s mysterious
errand. The morning after the ball,
when diphtheria developed, the house was
rapidly emptied. Even Josephine fled,
and left her lady in the hands of trained
nurses. Mr. West and a few domestics
stuck to their posts, the infected quarter
being rigorously isolated by means of
sheets dipped in disinfectant fluid.</p>

<p>Few of the gay guests ventured to leave
cards at the house. Diphtheria is an awful
scourge, and this is the age of microbes.
In old times ignorance was bliss.</p>

<p>Many kind inquiries and anxious messages
came by letter, and not a few
men questioned Mr. West at his club.
His daughter was such a lovely creature,
so full of vitality, she enjoyed every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
moment of her life. Oh, it would be a
thousand pities if she were to die!</p>

<p>Strange as it seemed, there was no
more regular inquirer than Mr. Wynne.
On the day when Madeline was at her
worst, when three grave doctors consulted
together in her boudoir, Mr. Wynne
actually came to the house; and later
he appeared to be continually in the club—which
was more or less empty. The
season was past. People were on the
wing for the seaside or the moors; but
Mr. Wynne still lingered on in town.
Mr. West was constantly knocking up
against him in the club hall or reading-room,
and the more he saw of him the
better he liked him. He was always so
sympathetic somehow about Madeline,
although he had scarcely known her, and
took a sincere interest in hearing what
the doctors said, and how they could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
understand how or where she had caught
the infection. There was not a single
case of diphtheria in their neighbourhood.</p>

<p>And his daughter’s dangerous illness
was not the little man’s only anxiety.
Part of his great fortune was also in a
very dangerous condition. The panic in
Australia was spreading, and though he
bore a stout heart and refused to sell—indeed,
it was impossible to dispose of
much of his stock—yet he never knew
the hour or day when he might not find
himself a comparatively poor man. As
soon as Madeline was better and fit to
move he would go to Sydney, and look
after his own affairs. Meanwhile he
began to retrench; he withdrew his commission
for the lease of a moor, for a
diamond and emerald <i>parure</i>; he put
down all his horses but two; and he
placed the Belgrave mansion on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
market. The house was too large to
be comfortable, and the sanitary arrangements
were apparently unsafe.</p>

<p>As soon as the invalid was pronounced
fit to move she was taken to Brighton,
where, there being no risk of infection,
Mr. and Miss West and suite were comfortably
established in one of the best
hotels, and at first the invalid made
tolerable progress towards recovery. By
the 1st of September she was permitted
to go out in a bath-chair, or even to take
a short drive daily. All who saw her
agreed that her illness had told upon
her most terribly. Her colour had departed,
her eyes and cheeks were hollow;
her beauty was indeed a faded flower—a
thing of the past!</p>

</div>


<p>As soon as practicable Madeline stole a
visit to Mrs. Holt, Mr. West having much
business of importance in London.</p>

<p>“I have been ill,” she gasped as she
tottered into the familiar kitchen, “or
I would have come back long ago.”</p>

<p>“So you have, I declare. Dear heart
alive! and aged by years, and just skin
and bone. Sit down, sit down,” dragging
forward a chair and feeling for the
keys, with a view to a glass of wine for
Mrs. Wynne, who looked like fainting.</p>

<p>“No, no. Never mind; I can’t stay.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
But tell me where it is, Mrs. Holt—where
have they buried him?”</p>

<p>“No, no. Now sit you down,” enforcing
her request with her hand. “Mr.
Wynne was thinking of burying him
with his own people in Kent; but it was
too far away, so he is laid in Monks
Norton, with a lovely stone over him.
I’ve been there,” and then she proceeded
to give the unhappy mother a
minute description of the funeral, the
coffin with silver plates, and a full account
of the last resting-place, keeping
all the while an angry and incredulous
eye on her visitor’s coloured dress.</p>

<p>“You are not in black, I see,” looking
at her own new black merino with some
complacency.</p>

<p>“No, Mrs. Holt; I—I never thought
of it, if you will believe me. My head
was full of other things and my heart too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
sore; but I will wear mourning outwardly,
as I wear it in my soul, and—heart—to
the end of my days.”</p>

<p>“Well, I do wonder as you never
thought of a bit of black,” sniffed the
other, incredulously. “’Tis mostly the
first thing!”</p>

<p>“Sometimes, I suppose,” responded
her visitor wearily. “And now, Mrs.
Holt, I must go; I know that you think
badly of me, and I deserve it.”</p>

<p>“Well, ma’am, I can’t say but I <i>do</i>!”
Her tone was of an intensity that conveyed
a far greater degree of disapproval
than mere words could convey. “But
my opinion ain’t of no value to the likes
of <i>you</i>.”</p>

<p>“You were very good to him. You
took my place; I will not thank you.
You do not want my thanks. You did
all for his own sake and for pure love.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
Oh, Mrs. Holt, if I could only live the
last two years over again!”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing like beginning a
new leaf, ma’am. You have Mr. Wynne
still.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Wynne will never forgive me—never.
He said so. He said——”
Then her voice failed. “Good-bye, Mrs.
Holt.”</p>

<p>“Ay, I’m coming to the gate with
you. I’ll tell Tom Holler where to take
ye; it’s in or about three miles. You’d
like a few white flowers? The lilies are
just a wonder for beauty.”</p>

<p>“No, no, no. I won’t trouble you. I
won’t take them,” she protested tremulously.</p>

<p>“Oh, but indeed you must!” Mrs.
Holt was determined that, as far as lay
in <i>her</i> power, Mrs. Wynne should respect
<i>les convenances</i>, and, seizing a knife as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
they passed through the kitchen, cut
quite a sheaf of white lilies, whilst Madeline
stood apathetically beside her, as if
she was a girl in a dream.</p>

<p>Monks Norton was an old, a very old
grey country church, thickly surrounded
by gravestones—a picturesque place on
the side of a hill, far away from any habitation,
save the clerk’s cottage and a
pretty old rectory house smothered in ivy.</p>

<p>As Madeline pushed open the heavy
lych gate, she was aware that she was
not the only visitor to the churchyard.
On a walk some little way off stood two
smartly dressed girls, whom she knew—London
acquaintances—and an elderly
gentleman, with a High Church waistcoat,
apparently the rector.</p>

<p>They had their backs turned towards
her, and were talking in a very animated
manner. They paused for a second as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
they noticed a tall lady turn slowly down
a pathway, as if she was looking for
something—for a grave, of course. Then
resumed their discussion, just where they
had left it off.</p>

<p>“It’s <i>too</i> sweet!” said one of the girls
rapturously, “quite a beautiful idea, and
you say put up recently?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented the rector, who took
a personal pride in all the nice new tombstones,
“only last Saturday week. It’s
quite a work of art, is it not?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” returned the second lady.
“You say that it was a child, brought by
the father, and that he was very much
cut up. His name was Wynne—one of
<i>the</i> Wynnes. It can’t be our Mr. Wynne,
Laura; he is not married.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there are dozens of Wynnes,”
replied her sister. “And you said it was
a sad little funeral, did you not, Uncle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
Fred? Only the father and a friend and
two country-people. The mother——”</p>

<p>At this moment the girl was aware
of some one coming behind her—a tall
person, who could look over her shoulder—some
one whose approach had not
been noticed on the grass; and, turning
quickly, she found herself face to face
with—of all people in the world!—Miss
West, who was carrying an immense
bunch of freshly cut lilies. She gave
a little exclamation of surprise as she
put out her hand, saying—</p>

<p>“Miss West, I’m so charmed to see
you. I heard you had been so ill. I
hope you are better?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have been ill,” returned the
other languidly, wishing most fervently
that these gay Miss Dancers would go
away and leave her alone with her dead.</p>

<p>They were standing before the very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
grave she was in search of—a white,
upright marble cross, on the foot of
which was written in gilt letters—</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Harry Wynne</span>,<br>
<br>
<span class="smcap">Died</span> [here followed the date],<br>
<br>
<span class="smcap">Aged 2 years and 7 months.</span><br>
<br>
“Is it well with the child? It is well!” (2 Kings iv. 26).<br>
</p>

<p>“We have just been admiring this
pretty tombstone, Miss West—so uncommon
and so appropriate. I have
never seen that text before, have you?”</p>

<p>Madeline turned away her eyes, and
with wonderful self-command said, “No,
she never had.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what Wynnes he belonged
to. It does not say. The head of the
Wynnes is very poor. The old estate
of Rivals Wynne has passed out of the
family. I saw it last summer. It is a
lovely old place—about two miles from
Aunt Jessie’s—delightful for picnics.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
Such woods! But the house is almost
a ruin. The old chapel and banqueting-hall
and ladies’ gallery are roofless. It’s
a pity when these old families go down,
is it not, and die out?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a pity,” she answered mechanically.</p>

<p>There was, after this, a rather long
silence. Miss West was not disposed
to converse. Oh, why could they not
go away? and her time was so precious!
Perhaps they divined something of her
thoughts; for the sisters looked at one
another—a look that mutually expressed
amazement at finding the gay Miss West
among the tombs of a lonely rural churchyard;
and one of them said—</p>

<p>“Is it not delightful to get into the
country? I suppose you are staying
in the neighbourhood for the yeomanry
ball?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>Madeline made no reply. Possibly her
illness had affected her hearing.</p>

<p>“This old church is considered quite
the local sight. Our uncle is the rector.
If you have come to look for any
particular grave, we know the whole
churchyard, and can help you to find
it with pleasure.”</p>

<p>This was one of the remarks that Miss
Laura Dancer subsequently wished she
had not made.</p>

<p>Miss West murmured her thanks, and
shook her head. And the girls, seeing
that she evidently wished to be by herself—and,
after begging her with one breath
to “come and have tea at the rectory”—pranced
down to the lych gate on their
high-heeled shoes, followed more leisurely
by the rector.</p>

<p>And at last Madeline was alone. But
how could she kneel on the turf and press<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
her lips to the cold marble and drop her
bitter tears over her lost darling with
other eyes upon her? How could she
tell that the windows in yonder rectory
did not overlook every corner and every
grave? She laid the lilies on the turf,
and stood at the foot of the new little
mound for half an hour, kissed the name
upon the cross, gathered a few blades
of grass, and then went away.</p>

<p>The Miss Dancers, who had a fair share
of their mother Eve’s curiosity, had been
vainly laying their heads together to
discover what had brought Miss West
to Monk’s Norton church; and over the
tea-table they had been telling their
aunt and uncle what a very important
personage Miss West was in the eyes
of society—how wealthy, how run after,
how beautiful, and what a catch she
would be for some young man if she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
could be caught! But she was so
difficult to please. She was so cold;
she froze her admirers if they ever got
further than asking for dances.</p>

<p>“All heiresses are said to be handsome,
no matter what their looks. She is no
beauty, poor thing! She looks as if she
is dying. How can any one admire
lantern jaws, sunken eyes, and a pale
face? Give me round rosy cheeks.”
And the rector glanced significantly at
his two nieces, who were not slow to
accept the compliment.</p>

<p>“Oh, aunty, she is shockingly changed
since I saw her last,” said Laura. “She
really <i>was</i> pretty; every one said so—even
other women. She had an immense
reputation as a beauty; and when she
came into a ballroom nobody else was
looked at.”</p>

<p>“Well, my lasses,” said the rector,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
rising and brushing the crumbs of cake
from his knees, “the world’s idea of
beauty must have altered <i>very</i> much
since I was a young man; or else your
friend has altered greatly. Believe <i>me</i>,
she would not be looked at <i>now</i>.”</p>

<p>So saying, he went off to his study,
presumably to write his Sunday sermon—perhaps
to read the newspaper.</p>

<p>His nieces put on their hats again, and
went out and had a game of tennis.
Tennis between sisters is a little slow;
and after a time Laura said—</p>

<p>“Look here, Dolly, supposing we go
up to the churchyard and see where she
has left those flowers. There would be
no harm in that, would there?”</p>

<p>Her sister warmly agreed to the suggestion,
and the two set forth on their
quest with eager alacrity.</p>

<p>They discovered the object of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
walk without any difficulty; for the
lovely white lilies were quite a prominent
object on the green turf.</p>

<p>Miss West had laid them upon the new
grave—the child’s grave. How strange!</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XL">CHAPTER XL.<br><span class="small">A FORLORN HOPE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The hurried expedition to the Holt Farm,
and subsequent visit to Monk’s Norton,
had not agreed with Miss West. She
had a most mysterious relapse, inexplicable
alike to her father and her
medical adviser.</p>

<p>The former had left her comparatively
better, ere starting for a long day in
London. Little did he guess that the
invalid had followed him by the next
train, had given Josephine a holiday, had
travelled into Hampshire, and gone
through more mental and bodily stress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
than would exhaust a woman in robust
health, had returned but an hour before
him in a prostrate condition—and had
subsequently kept her room for days.</p>

<p>“I cannot account for it,” the doctor
said. “Great physical debility. But,
besides this, there is some <i>mental</i>
trouble.”</p>

<p>“Impossible!” rejoined Mr. West,
emphatically.</p>

<p>“At any rate she must be roused, or
I cannot answer for the consequences.
She has no wish to get well. She
won’t take the trouble to live. I think,
if you could manage to get her on board
ship, a sea voyage might have a good
effect.”</p>

<p>Yes, that would be the very thing, and
fall in with Mr. West’s plans. A trip
to Australia.</p>

<p>“How about a trip out to Sydney?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>“Yes; and the sooner you can get
her off the better. Her illness is more
mental than physical. She will perhaps
recover amid totally strange surroundings,
and where there is nothing to recall
whatever is preying on her mind.”</p>

<p>“Preying on—stuff and nonsense—preying
on a goose’s mind!” cried Mr.
West, irascibly.</p>

<p>“I dare say whatever preyed upon a
goose’s mind would have a scanty meal,”
said the physician rather stiffly.</p>

<p>“But she has never had a care in her
life!”</p>

<p>“Umph!” rejoined the other doubtfully.
“<i>No</i> love affairs?”</p>

<p>“Not one.”</p>

<p>“Well, I won’t conceal from you that
she is in a most critical state. Take her
abroad at once; you have given up your
town house, you tell me; you have no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
anchor, no ties. You should start immediately,
and be sure you humour her,
and coax her into the trip, for it is only
right to tell you that it’s just touch and
go!”</p>

<p>This was terrible news to Mr. West.
His daughter had lost her looks, her
spirits, her health; was he to lose her
altogether? He broke the news of a
sea voyage to her rather timidly that
same evening. She listened to his eager
schemes, his glowing word-paintings, his
prophecy of a jolly good time, with a dull
vacant eye, and totally indifferent air.</p>

<p>“Yes, if he wished—whatever he
pleased,” she assented languidly. It
was all the same, she reflected, <i>where</i>
she died, on land or sea. But to one
item she dissented—she objected to the
proffered company of Mrs. Leach.</p>

<p>“This was just a sick girl’s whim!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
said Mr. West to himself, and he would
not argue out the matter at present; but
he was secretly resolved that the charming
widow should be one of the party.
She had written him such heart-broken
letters about Madeline from Scarborough
(but she had not seen Madeline since her
illness had been pronounced infectious).
There was no fear <i>now</i>, and the doctor
had said that a cheerful lady companion,
whom the invalid liked, and who would
share her cabin and look after her and
cheer her, was essential. Who so suitable
as Mrs. Leach? He would pay her return
passage and all expenses; and when
Madeline had retired, he sat down and
penned an eager letter to her to that
effect.</p>

<p>In two days Mrs. Leach was at
Brighton, with a quantity of luggage—boxes,
bags—and in a fascinating cloak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
and hat, had rushed into the hand-shake
of her dear Mr. West. She was looking
remarkably brilliant. Oh, what a contrast
to his poor emaciated child, who increased
her forlorn appearance by wearing
a black dress! She did not give Mrs.
Leach a particularly cordial reception.</p>

<p>“She does not care to see <i>any one</i>,”
explained Mr. West apologetically, when
he and his enchantress sat <i>vis-à-vis</i> over
dessert. “She takes no interest in <i>anything</i>
on earth—it’s mental, the doctors
say,” touching his forehead. “She has
had not only diphtheria, but some sort of
shock. She sits moping and weeping
all day; she never opens a book, never
opens her lips; she never listens to half
that is said to her; she won’t eat, she
can’t sleep, and she insists on wearing
black. I can’t understand it.”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Leach could; she saw it all.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
Whoever the man was in the background
of Madeline’s life, he was dead. Either
that, or he had deceived her, and, as a
result, she was almost crazy with grief.
And what a wreck!</p>

<p>Mrs. Leach took everything firmly in
her grasp at once; she was unusually
active and busy. They were to sail in
ten days, and there was Madeline’s
outfit; but here no interference was
permitted. Madeline selected her own
wardrobe—a few black gowns. However,
on the other hand, Mrs. Leach looked
well after Madeline’s correspondence; all
letters were brought first to her. She
did not wish Mr. West’s sharp eyes to
notice the swarms of bills which pursued
her, and she passed all his and his
daughter’s letters in review ere they were
laid upon the breakfast or afternoon tea-table.
Madeline never appeared until the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
afternoon, and exhibited no interest in the
daily post; she was, however, pleased to
see Lady Rachel and her brother, who
came down from town, ere their departure
to Scotland, expressly to wish her a <i>bon
voyage</i> and a speedy return. They were
really quite affected when they beheld
what was neither more nor less than the
spectre of Madeline West—the gay and
radiant girl of last season!</p>

<p>They had brought her books, flowers,
her favourite Fuller’s sweets, many scraps
of news, and, under the influence of their
infectious spirits, she cheered up temporarily.
Mrs. Leach, however, despite the
coldness of Lady Rachel and surliness of
Lord Tony, remained of the company, acting
as a sort of female warder; and there
was no really free intercourse. In spite
of broad hints, she stuck most pertinaciously
to her seat and her silk sock,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
throwing in observations every now and
then. Certainly she <i>was</i> thick-skinned.</p>

<p>At last Lady Rachel said boldly—</p>

<p>“Now, Madeline, take me to your
room, my dear.”</p>

<p>Madeline rose with an effort.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dearest, you must not go
into the draught on any account! I’ll
take Lady Rachel to mine.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you, Mrs. Leach; I rather
wish to have Miss West to myself for a
little, and I dare say she can wrap up if
the draughts are so much keener <i>now</i>
than at any other time of the day,” and
Lady Rachel carried her point.</p>

<p>“I wanted to speak to you alone,
Maddie,” she said as she closed the door,
“and that odious, thick-skinned, alligator
of a woman never gave me a chance!
She knows that I loathe her, and might
put you on your guard.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>“I am on my guard. I know her, I
think, even better than you do.”</p>

<p>“And you don’t like her?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t <i>trust</i> her.”</p>

<p>“I should hope not. She is a regular
sort of society adventuress; a notorious
evil-speaker, liar, and slanderer; always
poking into secrets, and levying genteel
blackmail. I had <i>such</i> an account of her
from Mrs. Berthon lately. I never liked
her—never; but I was not up to all her
history. Her father was a coal merchant,
and a man of very low origin—she is a
nobody. Major Leach was caught; he
thought she had a quantity of money.
That is always her bait—display, dress,
diamonds. His family no longer speak
to her, though she quotes them on all
occasions, and gives them as reference to
hotels and banks, and lets them in. She
owes my dressmaker six hundred pounds,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
and she has put her off with the excuse
that she is going to marry an immensely
rich man!”</p>

<p>“Really! who can it be?” indifferently.</p>

<p>“Can’t you <i>guess</i>, you dear blind
bat?”</p>

<p>“Not my father?”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope <i>not</i>. You must rouse
yourself and interfere; elderly men are
so easily made fools of. Is it true that
she is going with you to Sydney, or is it
just a piece of gossip?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is quite true.”</p>

<p>“Then you must stop it; you really
<i>must</i>, unless you wish to have her as a
stepmother. She will be engaged before
you are at Gib. I think I can see her in
smart board-ship frocks, very pleasant,
very helpless; your father, an idle man,
waiting on her assiduously, and carrying
her wraps and books; you below, <i>hors de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
combat</i>. Oh, she will not lose her opportunity,
and she sticks at <i>nothing</i>.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I can’t stop her!”</p>

<p>“I tell you you must. I wish I was
going with you instead.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how I wish you were!”</p>

<p>“But I can’t; my plans are cut and
dried by Mr. J. I shall write to you
often, dear, and expect to see you back
in six months, or at least twelve, looking
quite yourself; now, promise me.”</p>

<p>Madeline, whose spirits were running
down and a reaction setting in, made no
answer, save tears.</p>

<p>Lady Rachel’s warning sank into fruitful
soil. Madeline plucked up sufficient
energy to urge her father to relieve her
of her incubus.</p>

<p>“I should much prefer being alone; I
should indeed.”</p>

<p>“Pooh, pooh, my dear!” recalling her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
doctor’s advice, and thinking what an
agreeable shipmate he was providing, not
only for Madeline, but himself. “Nonsense;
it’s all settled, passages booked.
No change possible.”</p>

<p>“I shall be far happier without her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, rubbish! You are just weak now,
and fanciful. Mrs. Leach is devoted to
you.”</p>

<p>“I doubt it; and, father, let me tell you
a secret. I don’t like her. I am sure she
is not sincere. She is not straight.”</p>

<p>“Come, come; she is as sincere as
most women. I wonder who has been
putting these notions into your head—Lady
Rachel, eh? Mrs. Leach gave me
a hint. Lady Rachel is all very well,
and very pleasant; but a bit rapid, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Whatever she does is open and above-board,”
protested Madeline warmly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>“I’m not so sure of <i>that</i>, my dear.
Mrs. Leach knows a few things that
would never stand the light, and her
ladyship is aware of this, and that’s why
she hates our good friend, and wants
to set you against her.”</p>

<p>Madeline, weak and miserable, could
not argue. She was powerless against the
attractive widow. She, poor hollow-eyed
wreck, was no fitting opponent for the
fascinating Flora, whose battery of beauty
and smiles was most effective, and had
captivated Madeline’s susceptible parent.
Her influence was far more powerful than
Madeline’s, on the question of what was
for the benefit of the invalid, and the
invalid saw that it was useless to prolong
the secret struggle, and succumbed to
her fate.</p>

<p>Laurence Wynne had not come across
Mr. West for a considerable time; but he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
knew that the Wests were at Brighton,
and that Miss West was almost convalescent.
It was the end of October,
London was filling, and he was lunching
at his club, with one or two acquaintances
at the same table, when one of them
said—</p>

<p>“Hullo! there’s old West. I must go
and have a word with him presently. He
looks rather down; not half as smart and
perky as last year.”</p>

<p>“He has lost a good deal of money!”
observed the other.</p>

<p>“Yes; but not as much as is supposed.
He is an uncommonly shrewd old boy,
and knows when to save himself; but he
can’t save himself from his present trouble.
He is going to lose his daughter?”</p>

<p>“His what?” put in Wynne, quickly.</p>

<p>“Daughter. Surely you’ve heard of
the lovely Miss West? She was the rage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
for two seasons. She got diphtheria in
the summer, and——”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; I know,” impatiently.</p>

<p>“Well, he took her down to Brighton,
and she had a bad relapse of some kind.
I was there on Saturday last, and I saw
her. Her carriage had stopped at a shop
I was coming out of. I give you my
honour I had to look at her three times
before I was sure of her; she has lost
every particle of colour and flesh and
beauty. She might be thirty-five, and
gives one the idea of a person who had
seen a ghost, and never got over it.
Yes”—in answer to the expression of
his listeners’ eyes—“it’s rather awful.
She used to be so pretty; now she has
death in her face.”</p>

<p>“Are you in earnest, Ruscombe?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course I am. Old West is
in a deadly funk, and taking her off to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
Australia, as a sort of forlorn hope. But
he will never get her there alive.”</p>

<p>“Who says so?” he asked sharply.</p>

<p>“I thought you did not know her, man!
The doctor who attends her happens
to be my brother-in-law; and, of course,
we are all interested in the <i>beauty</i>. He
has a very poor opinion——Oh, are
you off? The fellow is mad. He hasn’t
touched a morsel. What the dickens!—Oh,
ho! Now, what does <i>that</i> mean—he
is button-holing the old squatter
himself?”</p>

<p>“No, Wynne, not seen you for ages,”
Mr. West was saying. “I never come
to the club. No spirits for anything.
My daughter is ill—got a sort of relapse.
The doctors say that she has some trouble
on her mind—must have had a shock.
Extraordinary case! She has never had
a care in her life!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Wynne made no answer, and
looked down.</p>

<p>“She can’t get up any strength, and—and
takes no notice of anything, does
not want to recover, and is just fading
away!”</p>

<p>“Ah, that’s bad! I suppose you have
the best advice that is possible?”</p>

<p>What a nice, kind fellow Wynne was!
When one was in trouble he quite took
it to heart too; he appeared—or was it
the bad light—actually grave and anxious.</p>

<p>“I’m taking her to Sydney, to try the
effect of the sea and change; it’s just a
chance—a last chance.”</p>

<p>“And when do you start?” he asked,
taking out his handkerchief and wiping
his brow.</p>

<p>“The day after to-morrow, in the
<i>Victoria</i>. We go from Tilbury Docks;
as she couldn’t stand the journey across,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
and, in fact, the more sea the better. A
lady friend is very kindly coming as her
companion, just for the trip; but Madeline
and I will not return to England for a
year or two. I’ll see how her native
climate will suit her.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I hope sincerely that it will,”
said Wynne. There was an atmosphere
of sympathy in his vicinity that had the
effect of compelling confidences.</p>

<p>“I think the London racketing
knocked her up, and I’m never going
to have a town house again. When I
come back, I shall buy some ancient
historical mansion, the seat of some old
family that have died out, and restore
it. That is, of course, if Madeline——”
He left his listener to fill in the sentence.</p>

<p>“Yes,” rather absently.</p>

<p>“I dare say you’ll be married and
settled by the time I see you again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>“I am not likely to marry,” he returned
quietly.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, yes; I forgot—a widower,
eh? And how’s the child? I always
forgot to ask?”</p>

<p>“The child is dead,” he answered
gravely.</p>

<p>“Dear me, that’s a pity; children are
a terrible anxiety, as <i>I</i> know! Well, I
hope to come across you again, Wynne.”</p>

<p>“I think it very likely that we shall
meet again, and very shortly, for I am
going out to Australia myself, almost
immediately.”</p>

<p>“No! Oh, I’m delighted to hear it!
Law business, of course, with an immense
fee, eh?”</p>

<p>“On most important business, at any
rate. And now I’ll say good-bye for the
present, for I have a great deal to do
before I start.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>“And I’ve been jawing away about
my family affairs and taking up your
precious time! I’m awfully sorry. I say,
I wish you could manage to come out
with us in the <i>Victoria</i>. Could you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll do my best.” And he hurried off
to wire to Fenchurch Street to secure
a berth.</p>

</div>


<p>The <i>Victoria</i> was a crowded ship. There
was a large contingent of Australian
passengers, also many Anglo-Indians who
changed at Aden, and a number of society
swallows who were bound for Italy and
Egypt. Madeline and Mrs. Leach shared
a four-berthed cabin, and enjoyed the
luxury of two spare berths, which served
as holdalls for their belongings. Mrs.
Leach had innumerable parcels, bags,
boxes, books, a jewel-case, a tea-basket.
She busied herself ere starting, in fixing
up her affairs, and annexed fully three-quarters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
of the available space. Madeline
was tired, and put on a tea-gown and
lay in her berth languidly watching her
partner making her toilette, arranging
her hair, her dress, her rings, ere sallying
forth to dinner and conquest. She
looked remarkably handsome, prosperous,
and triumphant as she turned to the
wretched girl in the berth, and surveyed
her exhaustively. She had adopted
a curious way of staring at her the last
few days—a gaze of polite, half-veiled
insolence—that was distinctly irritating.</p>

<p>“Well, dear Madeline”—the steamer
had left the docks, and was steadily
throbbing down the Thames—“so we
are off, you see, and I am of the party—no
thanks to <i>you</i>. Oh, I know all about
it, dearest, and I know what you would
little guess.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, no matter,” with a meaning
smile.</p>

<p>“No, I suppose it is no matter,”
wearily. Nothing mattered, she was so
tired—oh, so tired. She wished she was
dead, and she slowly closed her eyes on
her companion.</p>

<p>Mrs. Leach gazed at her in amazement.
What she knew <i>did</i> matter very much.
It was all very fine for Madeline to close
her eyes, and waive away a subject. She
would discover that she, Flora Leach,
had her in her power—she held her in the
hollow of her hand. Luck—she called
it—had dealt her an ace of trumps!
People were settling into their places as
Mrs. Leach entered, and there was the
usual confusion in the saloon—incidental
to starting. Mr. West had secured a
capital seat, and he and Mrs. Leach dined
happily together—and were generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
taken for man and wife. The dinner and
wine was good, the motion almost <i>nil</i>,
a mere slight shaking, and the widow
enjoyed herself vastly. Madeline was
rather tired, she said; Josephine was
looking after her. A little soup was all
she would take. Should she tell him
<i>now</i>? No, the situation was too public,
he would probably shout and make a
scene. She would wait for a day or two,
until they had their two deck chairs comfortably
drawn up side by side, under the
lee of a cabin, and when the dusk had
come and the stars were out, she would
whisper into his ear his daughter’s secret.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Leach retired to her cabin
that night, Madeline was asleep. How
pale and wan her face, how thin her
hands, she might be dead—she wished
she were. Then she took her bag out of
the bottom berth—she occupied a top<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
one by preference—and searching in its
pockets, got out a letter-case, extracted a
letter, and sat down to read it. It was
pleasant reading, to judge by her expression,
and she went over it no less than
twice. The motion of the steamer was
not so agreeable; in fact, it was becoming
more remarkable every moment. The
things on hooks were getting lively and
beginning to swing. She crushed the
note hastily into its envelope, thrust it
into her bag and began to undress as
quickly as possible.</p>

<p>The next morning they were off Dover
and the <i>Victoria</i> was rolling considerably.
Mrs. Leach was wretchedly squeamish.
She attempted to rise, she dressed with
less than her usual elaboration, and
staggered out into the saloon. Alas! she
was too bold; the smell of fried fish was
her undoing, and routed her with great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
slaughter. She lay in her berth all day,
and all the next day. Also Madeline;
but she was not a prey to Neptune—only
so tired—so tired of life, and everything.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon, a bustling, talkative
stewardess came in and, willy-nilly,
got her up, helped her to dress, put a
long cloak about her, and assisted her
upon deck about dusk.</p>

<p>“The air will do you good, miss. You
are no more sea-sick than I am. If you
stop in that stuffy cabin, you’ll be real
bad, and the gentleman said as I was to
fetch you, if you could stand. There’s
a nice long chair, and cushions and
rug, all waiting for you in a sheltered
place.”</p>

<p>And in this chair she soon found herself,
whilst her father fussed round and
wrapped her up. The weather was
certainly boisterous, the waves broke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
over occasionally with a long and vicious
swish; but the air was strong and invigorating,
and the pallid girl leant back
and drank it eagerly.</p>

<p>“There are a whole lot of people on
board you know, Maddie,” said Mr.
West, sinking into a seat beside her.</p>

<p>“Are there? I am sorry to hear it,” she
answered querulously.</p>

<p>“Oh, I say; come, come! and all so
anxious to see you again.”</p>

<p>“See me again!” with a weary little
laugh, “they won’t <i>know</i> me when they
do see me.”</p>

<p>“There is Lady Stiff-Staff going out to
Bombay with her daughters, and Captain
Vansittart, and Miss De Ville, who was
at school with you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t <i>bear</i> her!” was the
petulant reply.</p>

<p>He was about to add, “and Mr. Wynne,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
but she could not bear him either, nor
dare he mention that it was Mr. Wynne
who had urged him to get Miss West
on deck, at all costs, if she was not sea-sick;
Mr. Wynne who had helped to
find a stray corner, and brought up
cushions and rugs (Mr. Wynne who had
secretly tipped the stewardess a sovereign).
He was a nice, warm-hearted fellow. He
was glad he was on board (Wynne was a
whist player), he liked him. A pity
Maddie had such a prejudice against
him.</p>

<p>Mr. West talked on, asked for poor
Mrs. Leach. “Josephine, I hear, is dead,”
he remarked, “or <i>says</i> she’s dead. It’s
a mercy you are a good sailor. This bit
of a breeze is nothing. Wait till you
see how it blows off the Lewin! And I
dare say, once we are round Finisterre,
it will be a mill-pond. Now I’m dying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
to smoke, and as I know you can’t stand
it, I’ll go for a bit. Shall I ask Lady
De la Crême to come and sit here in my
place, and amuse you—eh?”</p>

<p>“Oh no—no. I don’t want any one,
I’m going down soon.”</p>

<p>She remained for some time in a half-dreamy
state, watching the sea, the flying
wrack of clouds, the somewhat faint and
timid young moon, which occasionally
peeped forth. Her eyes had become
accustomed to the dim light, when she
was rather surprised, and annoyed, to see
a tall man approach and coolly seat himself
in her father’s chair—which was
drawn up alongside, and almost touching
hers. Presently he spoke.</p>

<p>“Madeline,” he whispered, leaning
towards her.</p>

<p>“Laurence! Not Laurence?” she
exclaimed faintly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>“Yes—I hope you are better?”</p>

<p>“No.” A long pause, and then, in
a dead dull tone, she added, “I hope I
am going to die.”</p>

<p>“What is the matter with you?”</p>

<p>“They call it by some long Latin name;
but you and I know what it is.”</p>

<p>“Your father is still in the dark?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is scarcely worth while to
tell him <i>now</i>; no need to worry him for
nothing. When I am dead you will
forgive me, Laurence, and—and think less
hardly of me?”</p>

<p>“You are not dead, or going to die,
and I prefer to forgive you when you are
alive.”</p>

<p>“And will you—but no, you won’t—you
cannot—why should you? I
don’t expect it,” she said in hurried
gasps. “What can I do now to
atone?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>“Get better, get quite well, and I will
forgive you <i>everything</i>.”</p>

<p>She laughed, a queer little hollow laugh,
and then said—</p>

<p>“How strange that you should be on
board. Are you going to Egypt?”</p>

<p>“No—to Sydney.”</p>

<p>“Why? Have you friends there, or
business?”</p>

<p>“Both; urgent affairs, and I expect
to meet friends. Your father says he
is delighted that I am a fellow-passenger.
He likes me.”</p>

<p>“How—how extraordinary!”</p>

<p>“Yes; you do not flatter me. But at
least it is fortunate——Well, now, you
will have to go down. It is getting
rather chilly.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, no; I like being here. And
the cabin is stuffy, and Mrs. Leach is
so—so—such a wretched sailor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>“Then, I am truly sorry for you.
But you really must go. I’ll guarantee
to take you below quite safely.”</p>

<p>“No, no. Papa will——”</p>

<p>“It’s as much as he can do to keep
his legs, much less steer another. But,
if you prefer it, I’ll call the stewardess.”</p>

<p>“No; never mind”—rising and staggering,
and putting a mere skeleton hand
on his; and, as he supported her tremulous
steps, he realized how fearfully weak
she was.</p>

<p>They got downstairs safely, and, as
she paused, breathless, for a moment
under the great electric light, they looked
into one another’s faces for the first
time since that June morning.</p>

<p>It was all that Wynne could do to
repress an exclamation of horror, as a
white, hollow-cheeked spectre raised her
sunken, hopeless-looking eyes to his.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
Even the doctor’s brother-in-law had
not prepared him for <i>this</i>.</p>

<p>“Stewardess,” he said, as soon as he
could control his voice, “take great care
of this lady. Make her eat. Get her
some supper at once—some hot soup and
a glass of Burgundy. You must have
something to eat before you turn in.”</p>

<p>“Oh no; I could not,” she protested
feebly. “I don’t want anything.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes you do; and you will be
sure to come up early to-morrow. I’ll
come and fetch you about eleven o’clock,
weather permitting.” And he walked
off, and went on deck to a distant part
of the ship, and leant over the bulwarks
alone.</p>

<p>His old feeling for Madeline had come to
life. That wasted form, those tragic eyes
had touched him—cut him to the heart.
Yes; she looked as if she was about to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
follow the child. If she had been to
blame, he himself was not guiltless. He
had upbraided her too bitterly; he had left
her to bear her grief alone; he had not
made sufficient allowance for her youth,
her natural craving for the pleasures and
delights of girls of her age. The domestic
yoke had been laid upon her childish
shoulders, and what a cruel weight it
had proved! Why should he have been
astonished that she should be glad to
slip her neck from under it for a year
or two! She had no girlhood. She
was endowed with a gay, happy, sun-loving
temperament. He should not
have left the telling of their secret
in her hands; he should have spoken
to Mr. West himself. He would do so
now, within the next few days. If
Madeline was going to die, she should
leave the world as <i>Mrs. Wynne</i>! But,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
whether she was to live or die, she should
have his incessant care.</p>

<p>Day by day Madeline appeared on
deck, and day by day gained some steady
but scarcely perceptible improvement.
Mr. Wynne took much of her father’s
attendance off his hands, and left him
free to smoke and gossip and play whist.
He arranged her pillows and rugs in her
chair; saw that it was sheltered; talked
to her when she was inclined to talk;
told her everything that was likely to
amuse her; brought up, or caused to
appear at frequent intervals, soup, grapes,
champagne, tea, arrowroot, and used all
his persuasions to induce her to partake
of them. He had an unlimited supply
of magazines, books, and picture-papers,
which he read to her when she was
disposed to listen; and, when she had
looked them over, occasionally she fell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
asleep; and he sat beside her, contemplating
her white and death-like appearance
with a countenance to match.</p>

<p>However, every sleep, every smile, was
an inch on the road to recovery. Mr.
West was extremely obliged to him for
his kind attentions to his daughter. He
himself was very fond of Madeline, and,
naturally most anxious about his only
child. But he confessed that he did not
understand sick people, and was no hand
at nursing. He felt doubly grateful to
Wynne for his assiduity, and the politeness
and interest with which he listened
to his own discourse.</p>

<p>He talked to Wynne confidentially—chiefly
about finance. He had lost some
money lately—a good deal more than
he liked. But he never put his eggs
into one basket, and had a fair amount
in sound English securities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p>Wynne was a steady—well—friend.
Mr. West had recently experienced (and
resented) a certain palpable change in the
social temperature. He was no longer
flattered, deferred to—or even <i>listened</i> to—as
formerly. He was credited with the
loss of most of his fortune—every one
knew he had shares in the “Tom and
Jerry” Bank—and his daughter with the
loss of her beauty.</p>

<p>“The Wests didn’t amount to much
now,” to quote an American lady. This
conviction made Mr. West extremely
wroth. People thought he was played-out.
Whoever was particularly civil to him <i>now</i>
he took to his heart, and kept there.</p>

<p>One evening Laurence made his way
into the smoke-room, and stood looking
on at the termination of a rather hard-fought
rubber. His father-in-law was
playing. He was, moreover, holding good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
cards, and in a state of high jubilation.
His partner was Lord de la Crême.
Could this trim, rather jaunty little man,
holding the cards he was about to deal,
and laughing a loud, rather forced laugh
at one of his lordship’s good things—<i>i.e.</i>
a very middling joke—be a terrible
domestic autocrat? Who would believe
it? But Laurence looked below the
surface. That quick, fiery little eye,
now beaming so brightly, told a tale
that he could read. It spoke of choler,
obstinacy, of restless ambition, self-seeking,
and fury. Madeline, doubtless,
knew the capabilities of that eye, and
feared it.</p>

<p>When the whist party had dissolved,
and people were gone to their berths, Mr.
West—who was always prepared to sit
up—and Wynne were alone.</p>

<p>“I suppose Madeline went below long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
ago? You have been looking after her
as usual?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I took her down.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right”—pausing. “Then
play a game of <i>écarté</i>. There’s another
half-hour yet before lights-out.”</p>

<p>“No, thanks. The fact is”—seating
himself opposite, and squaring his arms
on the table—“I want to have a few
words with you.”</p>

<p>“With <i>me</i>? Certainly, certainly”—with
a momentary glance of surprise.
“About those investments?”</p>

<p>“No; it’s a more personal matter.
You”—hesitating for a second—“have
seemed to like me, Mr. West.”</p>

<p>“Seemed! Why, I don’t know a
single young fellow that I like as well.
You are clever, you are good company,
you are making yourself a name. I only
wish I had a son like you!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLII">CHAPTER XLII.<br><span class="small">WON ALREADY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Then, what would you think of taking
me for a son-in-law?” said Mr. Wynne,
fixing his dark eyes steadily on the little
man opposite to him, who was busily
shuffling the cards.</p>

<p>“Eh!” was his only reply for quite
a long time—an “eh!” incredulous,
indignant, and yet not wholly combative—a
long, sonorous exclamation. “Personally
I like you, Wynne—could not like
you better; but”—and he paused—“Madeline
is my only child; she is
remarkably handsome—<i>was</i>, I should say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
for the present—and created quite a sensation
in town. You are a very good fellow,
and a gentleman, but don’t be offended
if I confess that I am looking higher for
her. I expect the man she marries to
place a coronet on her head, and you
must admit that she will grace it!”</p>

<p>Laurence Wynne said nothing, merely
nodded his assent, and his companion—who
loved the sound of his own voice—resumed
volubly.</p>

<p>“Besides, Wynne, you are a widower!
And she does not like you; it’s all very
well when she is ill and helpless, and
tolerates you; it’s truest kindness to
tell you—and, indeed, you must see it
<i>yourself</i>! You have no idea the iceberg
she can be. I often wonder who she is
waiting for, or what she expects?”</p>

<p>“Look here, Mr. West, I can quite
understand your views. Mad—I mean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
Miss West—would, of course, grace a
coronet, as you say, but let me tell you
that we Wynnes, of Rivals Wynne, have
bluer blood in our veins than any of the
mushroom titles of the last two hundred
years. You will see, if you look in
Burke, that we were at home before the
Normans came over. We were Saxons,
and still a power in the land. Our family
title is extinct; but it only wants money
to restore it. I have relations who—like
some relations—turned away their faces
when I was poor; but were I to become
rich and successful, they would receive
me with open arms, and introduce my
wife and myself to circles as exclusive and
as far beyond the stray third-rate noble
paupers who prey on your—your good-nature
and—pardon me—your ignorance
as the moon is above the earth. I speak
plainly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p>“You do, sir, and with a vengeance!”
said Mr. West, a little overawed by the
other’s imperious manner, for Mr. Wynne
had said to himself, why should he be
timid before this man, who at most was
a <i>bourgeois</i>, whose father—best not seek
to inquire into his history—whose forefathers
had gone to their graves unwept,
unhonoured, and unsung, whilst he,
Laurence Wynne, though he boasted of
no unearned increment, was descended
from men who were princes at the time
of the Heptarchy!</p>

<p>“You value good birth, I see, Mr.
West,” holding out his hand as if to convey
the fact that he had scored a point.
“And you value success. I am succeeding,
and I shall succeed. I feel it. I
know it—if my health is spared. I have
brains, a ready tongue, an indomitable
will; I shall go into Parliament; think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
what a vast field of possibilities that
opens out! Which of your other would-be
sons-in-law aims at political life?
Look at Levanter, the reputation he
would bring you.” Laurence shuddered
as he spoke. “Do not all honest men
shun him? What decent club would
own him? Look at Montycute, what
has he to offer, but his ugly person, his
title, and his debts? He and others like
him propose to barter their wretched
names and, as they would pretend, the
<i>entrée</i> to society—not for your daughter’s
personal attractions, of which they think
but little, but her fortune, of which they
think a great deal!”</p>

<p>“Young man, young man!” gasped
Mr. West, inarticulately, “you speak
boldly—far too boldly.”</p>

<p>“I speak the sacred truth, and nothing
but the truth,” said Wynne, impetuously.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
“I offer myself, my talents, my career,
my ancient lineage, and unblemished
name for your daughter. As to her
fortune, I do not want it; I am now an
independent man. Give me your answer,
sir—yes or no.”</p>

<p>Many possibilities floated through
Mr. West’s brain as he sat for some
moments in silence revolving this offer.
Levanter and Montycute were all that
this impetuous young fellow had described.
He had good blood in his veins; he was
handsome, clever, rising, whilst they
were like leeches, ready to live upon him,
and giving nothing in exchange but
their barren names. This man’s career
was already talked of; he could vouch
for one success, which had agreeably
affected his own pocket, and, with the
proverbial gratitude, he looked in the
same direction for favours to come. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
had an eloquent tongue, a ready pen, and
a fiery manner that carried all before it.
He would go into the House, he would
(oh! castle-building Mr. West) be one of
the great men—Chancellor of the Exchequer—some
day. He shut his
eyes—he saw it all. He saw his
son-in-law addressing the House, and
every ear within its walls hanging on
his words. He saw himself, a distinguished
visitor, and Madeline among the
peeresses.</p>

<p>Laurence Wynne, keen and acute, was
convinced that some grand idea was
working in his companion’s mind, and
struck while the iron was hot.</p>

<p>“May I hope for your consent, sir?”
he asked quickly.</p>

<p>“Well, yes, you may, if you can win
her. You are welcome, as far as I am
concerned. Yes!” holding out his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
rather short, stubby hand, with one big
diamond blazing on his little finger.
“It’s time she was settled, and I’m afraid
she will never be what she was, as
regards her looks. I did hanker after a
ready-made title, but one can’t have
everything! I like you. You are tolerant
of an old man’s whims; you don’t
laugh at me under my own roof, and
think I don’t see it like some young
cubs; you are a gentleman, and I give
you Maddie and welcome, now that I
have talked it over; but the hitch, you
will find, will be the girl herself. She is,
as you may see, utterly broken down and
altered, and in no mind to listen to a
love-tale; but, well or ill, I must tell
you honestly that I would not give much
for your chance.”</p>

<p>“What would you say, sir,” said
Laurence, now becoming a shade paler,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
“if I were to tell you that I had won her
<i>already</i>?”</p>

<p>Mr. West looked at him sharply.</p>

<p>“The deuce you have! And when?”</p>

<p>“More than three years ago.”</p>

<p>“What! before I came home? when
she was at Harpers’? Were <i>you</i> the half-starved
fellow that I heard was hanging
about? Oh, never!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I was half-starved, but
I was most desperately in love with her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, so it’s an old affair?”</p>

<p>“Yes, an old affair, as you say, Mr.
West. And you have given me Madeline
if I can win her, have you not?—that is
a promise?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” rather impatiently. “I never
go back on a promise.”</p>

<p>“Well, now,” leaning forward and
resting his head on his hand, and speaking
more deliberately, “I am going to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
tell you something that I am certain will
surprise, and I fear will incense you;
but you will hear me out to the end.
We have been married for more than
three years!” He paused—not unnaturally
nervous—awaiting the result
of this tardy announcement.</p>

<p>“Why! what—what—what the devil
do you mean?” stammered Mr. West,
his little eyes nearly starting from their
sockets. “What do you mean, sir? I—I
don’t believe you, so there!—don’t
believe a word of it!” breathing hard.</p>

<p>“If you will only listen to me patiently,
you <i>will</i> believe me. I am going to tell
you many things that you ought to have
been made acquainted with long ago.”</p>

<p>Mr. West opened his mouth. No
sound came. He was speechless. And
his son-in-law proceeded very steadily.
“Four years ago you were said to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
bankrupt, if not dead. Mrs. Harper
gave you no law when your bills were
not paid. You have never heard that
Madeline, from being the show-pupil and
favourite, sank to be the shabby school
drudge—half-fed, half-clothed, and not
paid for the work of two governesses.
This went on for a whole year. I saw her
at a breaking-up affair, when she played
all night for her schoolfellows to dance.
I fell in love with her then. Miss Selina
hated us both, and, to satisfy her hate
and malice, managed—one night in the
holidays—to leave us both behind at
Riverside, late for the last train. We had
all been to the theatre. The affair was
planned. We waited where we were
desired to wait, and lost the train. Next
morning I called to explain to Miss Harper;
but Madeline’s character was gone—she
was turned out, dismissed without mercy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
She had no friends, no salary, no reference.
I had, at least, bread-and-cheese—so
I took her to London and married
her.”</p>

<p>He stopped and looked at Mr. West,
who was livid, and who cried out in a
loud, strange voice—</p>

<p>“Go on, sir—go on—and get it over,
before I go mad!”</p>

<p>“I was poor. We lived in lodgings;
but we were very happy. After a time
poverty and sickness knocked at our
door. I had typhoid fever. It was an
unhealthy season, and I nearly died. I
have sometimes since thought that it
would have been well if I <i>had</i> died, and
thus cut the Gordian knot, and released
Madeline. However, I hung on, a
miserable, expensive, useless invalid.
In the middle of all this a child was
born.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>Mr. West started out of his chair; but
subsequently resumed it.</p>

<p>“It was a boy——”</p>

<p>“A boy! Where is it?” demanded
his listener, fiercely.</p>

<p>“You shall hear presently,” said his
son-in-law, gravely. “Madeline was the
kindest of wives, nurses, mothers.”</p>

<p>“Madeline—<i>my</i> Madeline?” said her
father, in a tone of querulous incredulity
and shrill irritation.</p>

<p>“We had no money—none. I had
kept aloof from many acquaintances since
I married, and my relations dropped me
with one consent. We pawned all we
had, save the clothes on our backs.
We were almost starving. In those days
Madeline was a model of courage, cheerfulness,
endurance, and devotion. When
I recall those days, I can forgive her
much.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span></p>

<p>“Forgive her! Madeline pawning
clothes! Madeline starving!” cried her
father, so loudly that a sleepy cabin-steward
looked in.</p>

<p>Mr. Wynne signed to him to go away,
and continued, “Ay, she was. We
could barely keep the wolf out. Then
came your letter to the Harpers, and
they advertised for Madeline. She saw
the message, and pawned her wedding-ring
to go to them. And they, never
dreaming that she was married, received
her with rapture as Miss West. She had
no tell-tale ring, and Mrs. Harper heard
that she had been in a shop in London,
in the mantle department. In an evil
moment Madeline saw your letter wherein
you spoke very strongly against a poor
love affair, and possible marriage. So, in
desperation, and to get money and bread
for her child and for me, she deceived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
you. Later on, when the influence of
wealth and power and luxury ate their
way into her soul, she still deceived you—and
forgot us. I must speak the truth.”</p>

<p>Mr. West nodded.</p>

<p>“She put off the dreaded day of
telling you all, and I was out of patience.
She would not allow me to break the
news. You remember one evening that
I called in Belgrave Square, and we went
to look at a picture together? It was
then that I made my last appeal.”</p>

<p>“She gave you up, then?” he asked
abruptly.</p>

<p>“She did.”</p>

<p>“And the child?” eagerly. “My
grandson, my heir!”</p>

<p>“You remember the great ball you
gave last June?”</p>

<p>“Of course—of course,” irritably. “It
will not be forgotten in a hurry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>“He died that night,” said Mr. Wynne,
slowly.</p>

<p>“Eh! what did you say? Nonsense!”</p>

<p>“He died of diphtheria. Madeline
came too late to see him alive. It was
from the child she caught the infection.
Yes, I believe she kissed him. He was
a lovely boy—with such a bright little
face and fair hair. We kept him at a
Hampshire farmhouse. Many a time I
told Madeline that the very sight of him
would soften you towards us; but she
would not listen. She made promises
and broke them. She feared you too
much.”</p>

<p>“Feared <i>me</i>!”</p>

<p>“Since his death, I have had nothing
to say to her; but I heard that she was
very ill in London; and I used to find how
she was going on from various people,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
including yourself, as you may remember.
I thought my heart was steeled against
her, but I find it is not. I am ready to
make friends. I heard accidentally that
she was in a most critical state—that
day I saw you at the club—and I threw
up all my briefs and business and took a
passage.”</p>

<p>“And so <i>she</i> is your business in
Sydney?”</p>

<p>“She—she is most woefully changed.
When I first saw her under the lamp, I—I—I—cannot
tell you——” He paused,
and drew in a long, slow breath, which
said much.</p>

<p>“Poor girl! No wonder she looks as if
she had seen great troubles. I wonder
she is alive. Well, I’ll not add to them!
She treated me badly; but she has treated
you worse. And afraid of me! Why,
every one knows that my bark is worse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
than my bite—in fact, I have no bite.
And you stuck to her when she had no
friends! Oh what a treacherous old
serpent was that Harper—harridan.
Steady payment for nine years. And to
treat my daughter so! And I actually
gave that sour old maid a present for her
<i>kindness</i> to Maddie. They did not know
you were married to her?”</p>

<p>“No; scarcely any one know.”</p>

<p>“And what’s to be done! How is it
to be declared, this marriage. How is
the world to be told that Madeline has
been humbugging them for the last two
years as Miss West?”</p>

<p>“The wedding can easily be put in the
paper as having taken place in London,
with no date. It will only be a nine-days
wonder. We can send it from the first
place we touch at.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you are a clever fellow, Wynne.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
Hallo! the lights are going out, and we
shall be in darkness.”</p>

<p>“But you are no longer in darkness
respecting me.”</p>

<p>“Well, I feel in a regular fog. And so
you’re my son-in-law!”</p>

<p>“Yes; there is no doubt about that.”</p>

<p>“It’s odd that I always cottoned to
you.”</p>

<p>“You will not be harsh with Madeline,
will you?”</p>

<p>“Do you take me for a Choctaw
Indian, sir? I’ll say nothing at present.
Board ship is no place for scenes. She’s
very shaky still, though better.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think she is a shade better
now she is on deck all day.”</p>

<p>“It was an awful pity about the little
boy, Wynne, and——”</p>

<p>Here the electric light suddenly went
out, and Mr. West had to grope his way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
as best he could to his own cabin. He
lay awake for hours, listening to the seas
washing against the side of his berth,
thinking—thinking of what he had been
told that night, thinking of Madeline and
Wynne in a new light, and thinking
most of all of the little fair-haired grandchild
that he had never seen.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLIII">CHAPTER XLIII.<br><span class="small">HEARTS ARE TRUMPS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The night of the conversation in the
smoking-room, when Mr. West scrambled
below in the dark—not knowing, as he
subsequently explained it, whether he
stood on his head or his heels—was the
occasion of a curious incident in Miss
West’s cabin. Each day as she grew
stronger and better, recovering energy
and appetite, Mrs. Leach became worse,
and the weather to correspond. She
sustained existence on Brand’s essence
and champagne, and counted the hours
until they were in the Mediterranean—not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
that even the tideless sea can be
reckoned on in October. Mrs. Leach
felt miserably ill, peevish, and envious;
and when Madeline came down to go to
bed, she asked her to get her a bottle
out of her dressing-bag—“something to
make her sleep.”</p>

<p>“Shall I hand the bag up to you?”</p>

<p>“No, no, it’s open. A long, greenish
bottle—in the pocket next the blotter.”</p>

<p>Yes, the bag was not locked; the contents
were in great confusion—combs,
pins, handkerchiefs, note-paper. It was
not so easy to discover the little green
bottle. In turning out the loose articles,
Madeline came upon a letter addressed,
in Mrs. Kane’s scrawl, to “Miss West,
care of Mrs. Harper, Streambridge,”
forwarded to Belgrave Square, and from
Belgrave Square to Brighton. Some
one had kindly saved her the trouble of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
opening it, presumably the lady in the
top berth and the owner of the bag.</p>

<p>“Well, have you not found it yet?
Dear me, how slow you are!” she exclaimed
fretfully.</p>

<p>“Oh yes. I’ve found it.”</p>

<p>“Then do be quick. I feel as if I should
<i>die</i> from this nausea and weakness.”</p>

<p>Fortunately the little bottle turned up
at this instant, and Madeline (having
closed the bag and secured her letter)
handed it up to Mrs. Leach, who next
demanded “eau de Cologne, a handkerchief,
another shawl, a tumbler, and
some hairpins.”</p>

<p>It was some time before she was at
rest behind her curtains. The positions
were reversed, and Madeline, the invalid
on land, was not the invalid at sea. At
last she sat down to read her letter.
She had had no communication with Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
Kane since she had been at Harperton,
from whence she had sent her a ten-pound
note. Luckily for her, Mrs. Kane
never saw the society papers, and had no
idea that her late lodger had blossomed
out into a society beauty, much less that
she lived in London, otherwise undoubtedly
she would have had the
pleasure (?) of a visit from her correspondent.
The letter said:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“2, Solferino Place.<br>
<br>
“<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,<br>
</p>

<p>“I hope, in remembrance of
<i>old times</i>, you will excuse my writing;
but I am very hard set just at present,
and would feel obliged if you could spare
me a small matter of twenty pounds,
Kane being out of employment since
Easter Monday. I hope Mr. Wynne and
your dear baby are well. The baby must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
be a fine big fellow by this time—two
last winter—and a <i>great amusement</i>. Has
your pa ever found out the trick as you
played—how, when he thought you
was snug at school, you were a whole
year living in London in this house?</p>

<p>“I hope you won’t disappoint me regarding
the money, as having your <i>own</i>
interests to consider as well as I have
<i>mine</i>.</p>

<p class="right">
“Yours affectionately,<br>
“<span class="smcap">Eliza Kane</span>.”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>The postmark on the envelope was
dated two days before they had left
Brighton. And this was what Mrs.
Leach meant by her hints and looks.
This stolen letter was to be her trump card.</p>

<p>The next morning, when Madeline left
her cabin, she was met by Laurence. He
was, as usual, waiting, hanging about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
passage and companion-ladder. At last
a tall, slight figure in black appeared, a
figure that walked with a firmer and
more active step, and that no longer
crawled listlessly from cabin to deck.
It was Madeline, with a faint colour in
her face, she accosted him eagerly.</p>

<p>“Oh, Laurence!” she began, “I have
something to tell you. Come into the
music-room; it is sure to be empty.”</p>

<p>And then, in a few hurried sentences,
she unfolded her discovery and placed
Mrs. Kane’s nice little letter in his hands.</p>

<p>“Of course, now I shall speak. Of
course, I seem a miserably mean, cowardly
creature! It is only when forced by
circumstances that I open my lips at last.
Mrs. Leach has long guessed that I had
a secret and a <i>past</i>—but, strive as she
would, she could never find out anything
definite.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span></p>

<p>“This is very definite,” said Laurence,
dryly.</p>

<p>“It is, indeed. I could not understand
her intense scorn for me latterly. Laurence,
I meant to have told my father
immediately after—after last June, but
I was ill; and then, as I used to lie
thinking, thinking, I said to myself, I
may as well carry the secret to the grave,
for now the child is gone, and Laurence
is gone, what is the use of speaking?”</p>

<p>“But you see that Laurence is not
gone!” he exclaimed expressively; “and
we will let bygones be bygones instead.
I am before both you and Mrs. Leach.
I told your father last night. He took
it, on the whole, surprisingly well! I
have not seen him this morning, though.
He won’t allude to it at present. Board
ship is no place for scenes, he says; and
I am entirely of his opinion; so, my dear,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
you need not look so ghastly. Now, come
along on deck. We shall soon sight
Tarifa. Ah! here is Mr. West at last.”</p>

<p>The music-room was pretty full as the
little man came slowly towards the pair,
who sat apart on a couch at the end of
it. He looked unusually solemn, and
he had discarded his ordinary blue bird’s-eye
tie for a black one. He avoided his
daughter’s glance, and fixed his attention
on her mourning-gown, as he said—</p>

<p>“Well, how are you to-day, Madeline,
my love?”</p>

<p>“I feel better—much better.”</p>

<p>“That is good news! Then come on
deck and see the Spanish coast?”</p>

<p>He sat next to her—their steamer
chairs placed closely side by side—in
silence for a long time, smoking, and
apparently buried in thought; then, as
he suddenly noticed Wynne’s signet-ring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
on her wedding finger, he leant forward,
took her fragile hand in his—it trembled,
for he held it long and contemplated it
intently—and at last released it with
surprising gentleness.</p>

<p>“Madeline,” he said, “I <i>know</i> you’ve
had enough trouble. I’m not going to
say one word; but I’m greatly cut up
about what happened—last summer;”
and Madeline drew her veil over her face
to hide her streaming tears.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>After they had crossed the notorious
Gulf of Lyons, Mrs. Leach appeared, with
languid airs, expecting attention, solicitude,
and sympathy. Alas! for expectations.
What a change was here! Mr.
West was entirely engrossed with Madeline,
and was positively curt and gruff
(he had heard the history of the letter
in the bag); and when at last she found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
an opportunity of talking to him privately,
and began with little preamble about
“dear Maddie—such a marvellous sailor—so
<i>much</i> better—getting away from
some dreadful hold on her—and influence—seems
to have transformed her into
a new creature!” Mr. West looked at
the speaker keenly. The sea-breeze is
searching, and the southern sun pitiless.
Ten days’ sickness had transformed Mrs.
Leach into an <i>old</i> creature! She was
fifty-five or more, with her sunken cheeks,
and all those hard lines about her mouth
and eyes. What did they signify?</p>

<p>“Do I see Mr. Wynne on board?”
she asked, with a tragic air—“over by the
boats? How strange, how audacious!”</p>

<p>“Do you think so? He is Madeline’s
husband, and a great friend of mine.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Leach gasped! The wind had
been taken out of her sails.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span></p>

<p>“Then <i>you</i> know all about it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know all about it,” said Mr.
West collectedly.</p>

<p>“You have not known it for long—not
when we sailed?”</p>

<p>“No, not quite as long as <i>you</i> have,
Mrs. Leach”—looking at her expressively.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean, for one thing, that I obtained
my information through a legitimate
channel; that, as you are such a victim
to the sea, it will be only humane to
land you at Naples. It would be <i>cruel</i> to
take you on to Melbourne; and Madeline
has a companion entirely to her taste
in Laurence Wynne.”</p>

<p>“And oh what a tale for London!”
she exclaimed with a ghastly sneer. “I
am feeling the motion a good deal—perhaps
you will be kind enough to assist me
to get below? I find I must lie down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span></p>

<p>To tell the truth, she had been completely
bowled over—thanks to a strong
breeze and a strong opponent.</p>

<p>Mrs. Leach landed at Naples and enjoyed
an exceedingly pleasant winter in
Rome—due to a handsome cheque which
she had received from Mr. West, nominally
as a return for her kind interest in
his daughter, and really as a golden
padlock for her lips.</p>

<p>Mr. West, once in Sydney, contrived to
pull a good many chestnuts out of the
fire, and returned to England as wealthy
as ever, purchased the old estate of the
Wynnes, and restored the half-ruined
house in a style in keeping with its
ancient name.</p>

<p>Madeline and her husband spend
a great deal of their time at Rivals
Wynne, though their headquarters are
in London, and some day the old home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
will descend to the old race. The children
are beautiful; another little Harry
is the picture of the one that is lost, but
not forgotten, as fresh white wreaths
upon a certain grave can testify. Mr.
Clay, the rector, has seen Mrs. Wynne
placing them there with her own hands.
She made no secret of it <i>now</i>.</p>

<p>“It is the grave,” she explained, “of
our eldest little boy. I will bring his
brother and sister here by-and-by.”</p>

<p>The rector, when he takes strangers
round the churchyard, and points out the
most noticeable tombstones, halts for a
good while before a certain marble cross,
and relates the story of a mysterious
young couple who visited the grave
separately, but who now come together,
with other children in their train.</p>

<p>Mr. Laurence Wynne continues to
“rise.” He is in Parliament, and a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
of such note that Mr. West no longer
casts a thought on Madeline’s lost coronet.
Lord Montycute has married a rich
widow twenty years older than himself.
Lord Tony is happily settled, and Lady
Tony and Madeline are fast friends.
Lady Rachel is little Madeline’s godmother.
She is a pretty child, sufficiently
spoiled by her father, but ruined
by her doting grandpapa. She is an
imperious little person, but obedient and
docile with her mother. It is only poor
grandpapa whose miserably scanty locks
she puts into curl papers, whom she
drives about in a pair of long red reins,
and whom she rules with a rod of iron.</p>
